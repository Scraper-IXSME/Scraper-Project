Lindsay,"Ocala, FL","Reviewed June 9, 2023","I have worked with Rocket on two separate occasions. I cannot speak to actually getting a mortgage with them, but they communicate well, and they put everything up front. The first time, I was working to buy my first home, and they seemed like the best lender to go with. Their terms were the best for my situation, and they kept up with me and what was going on with me and encouraged me in my own work to get what I needed to start a mortgage with them.More",5
Lisa,"Evans, GA","Reviewed Feb. 13, 2023","My experience with Rocket Mortgage was beyond anything I could have imagined! When I originally bought my house in 2017, the experience was long, tedious and frustrating. I have actually put off a refinance for over two years simply because I didn’t want to deal with the process again. From my first day, Sam ** was constantly available, extremely helpful and quick, and total throughout the whole process I probably spent less than 30 minutes on the phone which was incredible and such a positive for me. Everything was extremely easy and convenient, I’ve told everyone who will listen to me to never buy or anything finance through anyone else. Thank you for making this process such a breeze! I will absolutely be back for any addictions mortgage needs.",5
Christopher,"Elgin, IL","Reviewed Jan. 13, 2023","Andreas ** was absolutely world class from the start of the loan process all the way through to the day of closing. He was available to me day and night and held firm with every promise that was made. Anytime we needed an escalation he personally sought out PJ and resolved the issue within what usually turned out to be an hour or two. Even at closing when I know I was supposed to be working with someone from that team, Andreas took my calls both at work and on his cell. He made Rocket Mortgage look hands down the best world class in customer service in the industry. I would strongly recommend anybody in my Family or Friends to rocket as long as the professionals were in line with how Andreas conducted himself. I give Andreas and Rocket a 11/10 and definitely a 5 star rating!!!",5
Rebecca,"Van Etten, NY","Reviewed Dec. 22, 2022","I was extremely nervous to utilize an online mortgage company. It seemed so impersonal. For some this is the biggest purchase you ever make in your life. I will, and already have recommended Rocket Mortgage. Ashli, and Scott were top of the line. Any time I had a question, it was answered. They were knowledgeable, sincere, and efficient. Going with an online company I really thought it would be a lot of phone tag, emails, and waiting. I never waited more than an hour before someone replied, or called me to touch base. That’s not including the touch bases to reassure me that everything was moving along as planned, or to just check in and see if I needed anything.More",5
Jason,"Jasper, AL","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2022","Thank You Rocket! It was a very smooth and easy experience using your online services... Submission of documents and the quick turnaround time made the loan pushed the process. I took advantage of your in house fsbo team and it was fantastic to get my purchase agreement made without having to rely on a realtor. The best part of the whole process was your people, from Lynn ** getting me into the right mortgage product and answering all of my questions quickly and knowledgeably... She took care of me like family and never let me feel I was out of the loop through the whole process. Hats off to Gary ** who also did an excellent job in the process of keeping me informed. Thank you so much! We are enjoying our new house and y'all were a part of that.",5
Kelli,"Brighton, CO","Reviewed Aug. 22, 2023","I am trying to buy a house in IL. I live in Colorado. Closing was to happen today so I am in IL now. I am paying 3/4 of the loan in cash. Last week, three things happened. The addendum to the appraisal failed to be delivered from the appraisal company on the east coast, Rocket became super-focused on my less than $200 Amazon bill and wanted a zero-balance notification, and Rocket wanted me to lower my monthly homeowner's insurance payments from $150/month to $50/month. This is all to improve my debt /income ratio but doesn’t take into consideration that I am selling my Colorado house and that I have funds in the bank to supplement my income until things settle. Everything is resolved after much effort EXCEPT the appraisal addendum.More",1
ROBERT,"Boca Raton, FL","Reviewed Aug. 5, 2023","Rocket in conversations, while applying for a loan, give me mostly bad information. Interest rate quoted was changed, closing costs were doubled and fixed rate mortgage applied for was changed to variable rate arm without my authorization. Really poor communication from broker and then he goes on vacation and left me with a women associate that also was horrible and know very little. Rocket strung me out for nearly a month with their bait and switch deception while I was trying to close the loan prior to additional interest rate increases. When I questioned why they changed everything in their second written proposal the women says they would not make the loan? Even though they cost me time and a higher interest rate I would not have proceeded doing business with this sorry and deceptive company anyway. Be aware!!!",1
Kelly,"O Fallon, IL","Reviewed July 24, 2023","I applied for a home equity loan with Rocket Mortgage. Some how during the on-line conversation with their representative, it turned into a loan refinance. The representative said we were not qualified for a home equity loan due to our credit and it would be better to refinance our loan. Our current VA loan has an interest rate of 3.24% and the rep tried to convince me to refinance for a 6.990% loan. I declined. He continued to try to convince me it was a better option. Again, I declined. We have received multiple emails and phone calls, even after unsubscribing from emails and declining phone calls. Today I received loan paperwork in the mail, which I again DECLINED. What does it take to get them to understand we are NOT INTERESTED in refinancing our 3.24%loan to a 6.990% loan? Rocket Mortgage needs to cease and desist contacting us, Immediately.",1
Kim,"Manchester Township, NJ","Reviewed June 26, 2023","They promised they wouldn't sell our mortgage. It is also stated in their advertising. Our excellent payment and credit history must not have been to their advantage. After harassing us for 2.5 years to re-refi our new mortgage, they sold our mortgage to a bank we would never have done business with. Unhappy and do not recommend them.",2
LiANN,"Houston, TX","Reviewed June 17, 2023","One year ago my husband and I experienced horrible customer service to the point of consulting with legal firms and the overseer of savings and loan entities. After working out a plan to get the issue resolved once and for all through a short repayment agreement. This company came BACK WITH ""oh you should have known the payment plan was going to fluctuate"". We were given a payment plan in writing and stuck to that, making each payment.More",1
Daniel,"Houston, TX","Reviewed June 9, 2023","I tried to refinance about a year ago, and they dragged their feet, submitted several inspections, and finally told me that my locked in rate had expired and all I could do now was to take the 1.25% higher rate. This was after inspecting twice, and claiming that they never received the appraisal (both of them). Their web page for auto payments is intentionally obstructive to setting up autopay. You cannot change an autopay amount. you must first delete the old one and create a new one. When you delete, you get ""A new autopay can be scheduled once this cancellation has been processed, usually by the next business day."" Why?More",1
skye,"Jackson, MI","Reviewed May 8, 2023","This company's behavior is unethical and potentially illegal. After going through the loan process, they decided to sell my personal information to other loan providers for their own financial gain. This is a clear violation of my privacy and trust. It is concerning that they would prioritize their own profit over the privacy and security of their customers. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. It is important to be cautious when providing personal information to companies and to read the fineprint carefully to ensure that they will not share your information with third parties without your consent. Overall, I do not recommend doing business with a company that engages in such questionable practices.",1
elliott,"Valencia, CA","Reviewed April 20, 2023","When I called Rocket Mortgage I was offered a rate that was not possible so they escalated to different division to cover up the bait-and-switch fraud. They hand you off to so many people it's like they created the Henry Ford factor line for mortgages. No relationship building, each person doesn't know what the other person is doing. They may be the largest but for sure are not the most organized or knowledgeable. It's like like they just push it through sometimes because they have gotten so far with the loan. I bet if they were really audited they would lot more legal problems.",1
Adam,"Des Lacs, ND","Reviewed April 18, 2023","I currently have a loan with Rocket Mortgage. In the past couple years I’ve been with them I’ve gotten hundreds of calls wanting me to refinance, I ended up just having to block their number. Now I’m going through an insurance claim and I sent the check to them 1 month ago and I can’t even get a human on the phone to find out if it was received. When you call their number it’s all automated press 1 if etc. about 3 times until it just tells you how to send the check. It should be way easier to access a human to actually get answers to my questions.",2
Jodie,"Aurora, CO","Reviewed April 6, 2023",I called three weeks before they were scheduled to pay my annual insurance premium and asked them not to pay it to my current carrier because I was changing companies. They disbursed it anyway even though the account said DO NOT PAY. Now I have to try to get the money back to return it to them so that my escrow account is not short from a double payment when they disburse the money to the new carrier.,2
James,"Sparta, WI","Reviewed March 30, 2023",After finding out our legal description was wrong back in 2015 we thought everything was fine as the attorney we had sent all corrected legal documents to Rocket Mortgage. We didn't hear anything more until Christmas 2021 when Attorney papers came saying that the homes affected were illegally sold. The mortgage company never fixed the legal documents for the properties affected from back in 2015 and never gave us a heads up. We then thought we had that fixed but then at the start of this month I am told we are in arrears by over $2400.More,1
andy,"Chantilly, VA","Reviewed March 29, 2023","The most answers comes from a certain department and all other department. When you talk to they just guess and each of them say a different thing until after while and time passes answer comes from that particular department, very annoying people. Please do your homework before you start working with them.",1
Simmone,"Hightstown, NJ","Reviewed March 20, 2023","Updated on 03/20/2023: I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 after finally speaking with my loan officer, Patrick D.

Kregg,"North Branch, MN","Reviewed March 15, 2023",Loula was awesome. This is the second time she has helped me buy my house. She really does care and does everything possible to get it done. I will recommend her to everyone. My deals have never been easy and she has always worked through all the issues.,5
Nanette,"New York, NY","Reviewed March 9, 2023","We returned to Rocket for a mortgage because of a positive experience we'd had with them, especially with the loan origination people. There seems to be a problem however, when the client is handed off to the team that handles the process of finalizing the loan and moving to closing. This second time with Rocket was similar to the first, great service from Keeb with the process of getting the loan started and guaranteed, then poor service from Julia who took over the process after our offer was accepted and we were moving toward closing. She was a poor communicator - gave us conflicting explanations, didn't tell us what she needed, didn't answer our questions - leading to a lot of unnecessary stress.More",3
Nate,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed March 8, 2023","Amazing experience all the way around!!! From start to finish - extremely efficient and of high quality at every point. The customer service reps were very knowledgeable and extremely helpful, provides updates in a very timely manner which makes the process much much better. Would recommend them to anyone looking to refinance. I would absolutely look to use Rocket Mortgage again in the future.",5
David,"Stonington, CT","Reviewed March 6, 2023",Getting our first mortgage was simple and professional. We applied for a home equity loan. Night and day. We were approved then told no after commitment. They could care less. Pull the product if the staff or approval software are not up to snuff. No more recommending them except Joe for a mortgage was outstanding.,1
Ferdinand,"Katy, TX","Reviewed March 3, 2023","After spending hours with a loan prescreening representative and providing information on the nature of my application twice, once online and then with a live person. I had to use a live person because you're not really able to do online everything that’s in the meta tags that draws you in. Something is wrong when a company like this denies a person with a credit score above 770 and financials that meet all the requirements for this very small loan for an investment property. They knew and understood beforehand exactly what my intentions were regarding the nature of my loan and wasted hours of my time on the phone just to tell me that they couldn’t do it, without any clear explanation. It sounded as if it were being made up as she talked and I still.",1
Timothy,"Royal Oak, MI","Reviewed March 2, 2023","From beginning to end, this was an outstanding experience! Frank Jamal and Michael ** were fantastic. Frank from the get go was super helpful, informative and every step of the way the whole team was ahead of the curve. Everyone was easy to reach and always answered my questions.

Robin,"Meridian, MS","Reviewed Feb. 27, 2023",Awesome experience. Tiffany was just outstanding. And so we’re the other employees that I worked with. They made it so easy!! Thank you. Will definitely recommend Rocket mortgage to my friends and let them know all about my experience!,5

Aaron,"Spring Creek, NV","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2023","Everything went well with Nelson at the beginning of the process. I would use Rocket again in the future. Some things got tied up at the end waiting for closing and I think someone dropped the ball causing a delay. It might have been on the title company's side. I kept checking for my responsibilities for over a week, and the portal said there was nothing for me to do. I finally called to double check and then things moved really quick.",4
Alvaro,"Malden, MA","Reviewed Feb. 22, 2023","I called last month while shopping around for Mortgage Products. In short, their rates and fees weren't the best, and I told them I'd need some time to calculate/mull it over. The rep said ""Well why do you need to think about it? You're not going to get any better so you might as well go with us."" As creepy and, quite frankly disrespectful a response that is, I insisted I'd call back another day. Since then, (going on about a month now) they call me anywhere from 2-5 times a day--as early as 7am and as late as 8pm. The same number. Every. Single. Day. I have the call log & screenshots to prove it. They've lost my business indefinitely and I implore anyone reading this to go literally anywhere else.",1
Albert,"Fort Mohave, AZ","Reviewed Feb. 22, 2023","My experience with Rocket Mortgage was very quick, efficient & very easy, I would recommend Rocket Mortgage To anyone needing their kind of services.

Connie,"Yates Center, KS","Reviewed Feb. 14, 2023",Process was very smooth and customer service answered any questions we might have very quickly.

Robert,"Old Greenwich, CT","Reviewed Feb. 10, 2023","Provided me with a Federally Funded CARES Mortgage deferment. Told me they would modify the loan and put the deferred payment, 6 at the end of the loan. Now tells me they wouldn't do that and are demanding the entire $19,000 payment at once and will be foreclosing on me and my 11 year old daughter's home. They refuse to accept any payments, even the regular monthly mortgage payments which I have been making on time, now tells me they won't accept any payments, expediting the foreclosure. Terrible, bullying unethical practices. After agreeing to help me during Covid they now destroy my credit, and are removing me and my daughter from our home for $19,000. Stay away from these thugs.",1
Karen,"Myrtle Beach, SC","Reviewed Feb. 8, 2023",We have been very pleased with Rocket Mortgage. Everything went smoothly from beginning to end. It was so easy to get forms filled out and submit online. Our only complaint is all the mail about mortgage insurance with the amount of our loan on a postcard for everyone to see. That is unacceptable,5
Daniel,"Round Lake, IL","Reviewed Feb. 7, 2023","Was Leary about Rocket Mortgage. It was a great experience. All their folks are professional and great communication. Highly recommend.

Sp,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed Feb. 5, 2023",High fees. Promise what they cannot deliver. Rude. Twice now. Never again. There are a lot of better options out there. The last guy was purposely deceitful. One a refinance and the second a purchase. This is the only company that would not be transparent with a cost breakdown upfront as well. There is a reason.,1
Jonathan,"Glendora, CA","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2023","I'm a first time home buyer in the city of Glendora. I was referred to Rocket Mortgage by the realtor I used to buy the home. If you understand the Ins & Outs of buying a home then I'm sure this is a decent company to use, but if you're a first time home buyer I would avoid them at all costs. Pete ** was my representative and is a very nice gentlemen, but spoke to me as if I worked as a colleague and thought I understood this process of buying a home. He was communication skills were awful, locked me in at points that I did not agree with, and still getting hit with unknown bills that he didn't clarify to me when spoke. Ultimately, first home buyers should be treated a lot better than the experience I had and would advise to look elsewhere.",1
Melinda,"Amory, MS","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2023","From start to finish, this has been been the best process! It was easy, fast, and everyone was so polite and helpful. All my questions were answered.

Rick,"Plainfield, IL","Reviewed Jan. 12, 2023","I have been with Rocket Mortgage for quite some time. Earning in excess of 12K monthly, I was in a position to finally get into a 10 year fixed at 2.25%. Great deal, excellent service, really impressed. Found myself unemployed for the first time in my life in January of 2022, and struggled meeting all obligations. I have never missed a mortgage payment since I have owned real estate, over 40 years! I received an offer to start working in January of 2023. I contacted Rocket in August about options. I had read that they could defer a few payments to the end of my loan. Instead I was set up on a ""forbearance"" program. Found out they will only re-structure my loan and add 4% and additional length to my loan. After to speaking with multiple reps, including the ""executive team"" , they advised me that this what they decided. When I advised them that I was mislead, they said, ""It all in your documents.""More",1
Elainne,"Rochester, NY","Reviewed Jan. 11, 2023",This was the easiest platform and customer service experience I’ve received while trying to refinance. Amazing.

Shawn,"Halifax, MA","Reviewed Dec. 30, 2022",I cannot begin to say how pleased I was with the whole experience.

Stephen,"Myrtle Beach, SC","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2022","If you have a choice of Mortgage Companies and their servicers, do EVERYTHING you can to avoid Rocket Mortgage. Their staffs are typical Detroit-breakdown. No ability to deal with you as a specific customer. Only thing that THEY SAY matters to them is to follow processes which grind down the customer, regardless of loan-to-value metrics or the customer's needs. I had an insurance claim for a new roof for $29,840 and they withheld $22,604 of it in an ESCROW account which I can't access - with no instruction or notice how to navigate their ""system"". Scammed by roofers. Scammed by insurance. And now scammed by Rocket. NOT the Dan Gilbert I know.",2

Bragged about being on CNBC (which admittedly, did make me think I was in good hands). I explained that I was a 1099 contractor and that my income has been a problem in the past. Was told to rest assured that these things will not be an issue with him handling my loan.

Daenerys Stormborn,"Panama City, FL","Reviewed Oct. 28, 2022","Use extreme caution and if possible, just go with someone else. What they don't tell you: THEY WILL SELL YOUR LOAN FOR PROFIT. They will tell you nothing will change but this is NOT TRUE. Here's the story: The process started easy enough, the agent whom I was dealing with made everything sound super easy and I genuinely liked him at first. A big selling point of our home was the monthly payment. We were determined to stay within a certain range. The price we were given was a bit higher than we expected; however, the agent informed us that there was a PMI on the loan. He said that its a bit more to pay now... but being that we got SUCH a good deal on the house, we would only have to wait around a year to get this off.More",1
David,"Newark, NY","Reviewed Oct. 27, 2022","Went fairly smoothly. There were a few glitches on getting forms signed and back in a timely matter.

We bought this house with Rocket Mortgage in June 2021 with Brian on the loan and both of us on the deed, written as Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship. Basically that meant if one of us died, the house would automatically belong to the other. Brian died in November. I waited to notify them because I was afraid they would foreclose on the house, but as I learned more about what happens when your spouse dies with an open mortgage, I realized Federal Law prevents a mortgage company from foreclosing on a home loan where the payments are kept current and there is a successor in interest.More",1
Randy,"Rocky Mount, NC","Reviewed Oct. 20, 2022","I recall being told that part of the monies taken out would be paid to my debtor(s). But in fact, Rocket Mortgage drafted checks and mail them to me directly. I found this to be a great inconvenience as everything is done electronically these day. ll I believe that Rocket could do better in this area. All the other lenders provide a web portal where you can enter the your debtor's name and account number and submit payment approval. Additionally, Rocket has no safety net for discriminating (racist) home appraisers.",3

Dr Peggy,"Ventura, CA","Reviewed Oct. 1, 2022","I tried twice to pay off this company of, per their instructions, I was NOT able to accomplish that. Once was due to their dinging my wire $50 and then they said my pay off was short that amount, WTH was that about, they then also dinged me another $50 to return the wire, thank god my bank credited me back that amount but as far as every doing business with Rocket again that's very slim to NONE. They are very accommodating at the the start and then pass you along to many, many, many others to the point where you don't have any one person you can connect with that really understands you as a customer!

Jennifer,"Byron, GA","Reviewed Aug. 25, 2022","During our home buying process we had a lot of ups and downs but Garett was amazing, 5⭐️. But the second agent we had Erik was not amazing. They took over two weeks to verify the HOI then over two weeks to verify my husband's employment which is the Air Force meaning he has signed his life away for the next four years. At least 4 times they threatened to move our closing date to no fault but their own not ours. It’s not only our time that was being wasted but multiple other parties' times. It was honestly unprofessional how many time we had to call and get the ball even moving up to the day before closing.

Everything would’ve already been paid off and took care of by now.

James,"Owasso, OK","Reviewed July 12, 2022","Rocket Mortgage was very thorough and efficient throughout my mortgage process. However, I was annoyed by the fact that rather than discussing loan terms with me, they added points to the loan by default. Despite me attempting to ask questions, I never received clear answers in regard to the way the loan was structured. Luckily, I had a friend in the industry who I was able to discuss my loan with. Most of this was because I was shuffled between several reps due to my main rep being on vacation, but that is more an excuse than a valid reason. Other than that, the rest of the loan team was excellent. Had they actually discussed my loan structure with me rather than making assumptions that I had to correct after the fact, this would have been a 5 star experience.",4

In my case one vendor was substantially overpaid resulting in my being charged a fee and my refund could take up to 8 weeks. Another account that was paid off had a higher balance and resulted in me writing a second check to cover the difference.",4

Melinda,"Allensville, KY","Reviewed May 5, 2022","I was put in for an FHA loan at first-WITHOUT my knowledge! There were new tasks on our dashboard EVERY DAY! When I FINALLY talked to Matt, he set me up for conventional. We went through with the appraisal and no word from him for days. I texted to ask and his reply was that the appraisal was taking longer than usual. After the 2nd week, I texted Matt to say that, ""I'm under the assumption that this loan is not going to happen"". He replied back with, ""It came in at X AMOUNT, I'm working on the approval now"". After hours of no word from Matt, I logged in to my dashboard to find a letter of denial. VERY unprofessional way to learn that we were denied. It states in the denial letter that someone should have already SPOKEN with us about our denial... That was NOT the case!!!! No way I would recommend this kind of behavior to ANYONE!!!",1
Gary,"Sierra Vista, AZ","Reviewed May 5, 2022","I wanted to catch the wave on low interest rates before the fed pushed the rates higher but feared my credit score was too low. I decided to submit to Rocket just to try and see what came of it! It was a Sunday night, within 1 hour I received a call from a Rocket Rep (Sunday), I was shocked. Every step of the way this person worked with me, answered questions, and noted my credit score was actually good (Credit Karma, whatever!), anyway this person even cleared a concern I received from another well know reality company debunking comments made about Rocket!!More",5
Refi,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Reviewed May 5, 2022","They will call you non-stop and not remove you from their call list, no matter how many times you ask. They give misinformation to customers and refuse to do anything to assist customers with anything other than taking their money. I went from Wells Fargo where I had a horrible experience then I moved to Quicken Loans and the Rocket Mortgage took over. Ever since Rocket Mortgage has been involved the customer service and experience has gotten worse and it is now essentially the same status of Wells Fargo. They are nothing more than a machine that will take you for every penny they can take without a care in the world about their customers or the humans behind the dollars. Such a sad death of a formerly ethical company. RIP Quicken Loans.",1

The closure consultant didn't provide me enough information and advice regarding the way they handle the closure numbers, especially the seller's credits, and that caused us a loss of money. When I posed the problem the final response from the executives was ""We understand that the experience when closing could have been better. However, the loan is closed and we can not change how the loan closed"". In previous communications, they accepted the error, but unfortunately, they don't have the willingness to make it right.",1

Everyone I worked with at Rocket Mortgage was professional and friendly and things basically ran smoothly the whole way through. The only thing I might suggest improving on is the communication around the time of the appraisal and closing. It wasn't always clear what was going on and what the anticipated time frame for the different steps was. It's not a major problem and as I said we are happy with the refinance process overall, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",5

Amy,"Des Moines, IA","Reviewed April 17, 2022","Rocket Mortgage is awful! I'm trying to refinance and it's been a nightmare. Too many people involved and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I originally had Tyler ** as my personal banker. We started off with a conventional loan. My DTI was high (apparently he didn't check this originally??) so he ends up switching my loan to FHA without asking me or telling me about it. When I first spoke with him I specifically told him I didn't want PMI. FHA loans always require PMI. I left Tyler numerous messages and sent numerous emails with no response. When I did get a call, he would call me at work when I asked him not to. I had so many questions that never got answered. Eventually my requests were escalated to Shelby **.

I then proceeded with a refinance through AmeriSave for cheaper costs and a better rate. Scott ** with Quicken/Rocket contacted me only after receiving my payoff request from AmeriSave. Looking back now, I probably should have not stopped the refinance process with AmeriSave when Scott **contacted me. This scenario of having Scott call me after Quicken/Rocket received my Mortgage payoff request from AmeriSave now seems questionable and possibly a business tactic rather than a best practice.

He told me that it was a ""Soft Credit Check"" and it wouldn't go on my credit report. This was not correct and it not only appears on Credit Karma, but when I ultimately went with another lender I had to write a letter of explanation on why this credit check by Rocket Mortgage was appearing on my credit?

Aaron,"Waterford, CA","Reviewed March 10, 2022","My number was sold to 3rd parties, I received hundreds of solicitor calls from early morning till late at night. Starting at 5am call after call not stopping until 10 pm. This happened the very next day after the loan closed. You guys made thousands of dollars from my loan. How much money is enough? Can’t imagine how much is made from the sale of personal info, but it makes life hell to have to tolerate my phone ringing every few minutes for days on end. Not happy.",2

James,"Waukesha, WI","Reviewed March 3, 2022","The loan process was smooth, almost everything was done electronically. However, the payoff checks were issued checks. The difficulty was adjusting the payoff amounts, almost all the checks were over paid. Even after I uploaded the statements, only a couple checks were updated. Now I'm having to chase down my accounts to get a refund. And some of them are going back to Amrock then I need to follow up with you to get it back. This is very redundant specially in a digital age we're in and Rocket is all about ""e"" processing. I understand the security reasoning but ACH depositing back into my account is not too much to ask when it's the same account number that you have for years. Disappointing actually.",4
George,"Hockessin, DE","Reviewed March 3, 2022","The entire mortgage refinance process was handled professional with excellent listening and knowledgeable employees.

My loan advisor, Jenna, was superb at communication, explaining and re-explaining as needed, and keeping me up to date on the process. I found the interface for 100% of my interactions on my phone to be excellent. The app works very well. Each time I called I did speak to a different person, but each was very knowledgeable and consistent with their customer service and ability to answer my question or fix my problem. I am extremely happy with this process and will recommend to a friend, for sure.",5

When it came to the actual loan process there was an additional $5,000.00 added to the loan estimate. On a $240,000.00 loan. An extra 2.1%. I was already facing higher fees due to my credit rating. Also, they were very aggressive with me. Asking for passwords to my retirement account, demanding information within the same day, double teaming me with two representatives.

Timothy,"Surry, NH","Reviewed Feb. 21, 2022","NoI provided every document you asked for and there were no issues until 10 days after the closing took place. 10 days after the closing I still had not received my disbursement and had to call and ask what was going on.. Oddly enough, every other time you needed something I got an infinite number of emails from you. The gent in charge of the payouts was away and someone else spoke with me. Issue resolved...10 days late. Then, believing the payout to TD Bank Autofinance had been made by you, as I was told it would be, I received a UPS package with a check made out to TD Bank...you never sent it to the bank and it was made out for the wrong amount.

Jean,"Madison, GA","Reviewed Feb. 21, 2022",Everyone was very helpful and answered and our questions in a professional and timely manner. We would recommend Rocket to friends and family.

Brenda,"Stockbridge, GA","Reviewed Feb. 18, 2022","We were delighted with Rocket Mortgage from the start to the closing. The only thing that kept our rating from 5 stars is being barraged with mortgage insurance offers! Five notices in the mail, four almost identical on pink paper, two phone calls and a text (when I didn't answer the call)! I did text back asking to be removed from this list. I hate that our wonderful experience is blemished with this kind of unwanted pressure. We would still recommend Rocket Mortgage, but would warn anyone about what to expect after.",4

The rate was increased. The type of loan was changed and your underwriter was not pleasant to work with.

I will probably never work with you again.",3
Vijaya,"Escondido, CA","Reviewed Feb. 16, 2022",Very pleased with process and service. Your service banker was very knowledgeable and gave the best mortgage that suit my long term plans and terms. Your closing partner Amrock was very efficient as well. We appreciated the updates at every level.,5

After paying off my HELOC, RM refused to issue me an intent to reconvey letter so I could clear the title to my home. They told me I would need to wait up to 3 to 4 months until the “paperwork” went through the system. By the way, the loan was paid off with a direct wire transfer from Charles Schwab, so the excuse of “waiting until the check cleared” was dishonest.",1

Had many emails with them and took over a week past closing to get them to reissue checks. Terrible customer service. On my previous refinance with Rocket, AmRock was a hold up on closing as well back then. If I have need for another home loan in the future, I probably will shop around due to the two bad experiences with AmRock. I’m assuming that Rocket owns AmRock.",3

This second representative then wasted more of my time badgering me with personal questions having nothing to do with my qualifications for a loan (as she herself admitted), then hammered away at me trying to talk me into refinancing my first mortgage, told me I would save money, but a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation confirmed that this was incorrect--I will pay less to get a home equity loan with someone else (even at a higher rate) than to refinance.

Reason given, they couldn't get an appraiser. Their solution, drop the refinance and suggested we go to another lender. When I called in to discuss the matter they admitted knowing they couldn't get an appraiser, its an ongoing problem. So Rocket hit our credit and took our financial information in a fraudulent manner when they knew they couldn't provide the refinance they offered us.

I was informed that there was money in my escrow account that would be reimbursed to me after closing and extra funds wouldn't be necessary. I obviously listen to the advice seeing they are the mortgage professionals. After closing, I received a check for a fraction of what was promised. They failed to say that they take the escrow overage to pay off the original mortgage pay off amount.More",1
Jacqueline,"Marietta, GA","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2021","We recently re-financed our home. We were given a start time of Dec 1 to have our first payment due on this new loan. We received a hard copy letter on Nov 24 stating that our payment was late. This was the first payment and to our understanding was being requested one month early. We immediately began combing through emails and voicemails. No voicemail was left from them, although Vanessa a supervisor told me without any dates or times given - that an automated service called us several times. Again - no voice mail, no dates, no times and no numbers given to me during the call to Rocket Mortgage to support her claim. We did find two communications sent through email in spam. Immediately my husband set us up on an auto-draft to ensure that this does not happen again. I called to speak to a Rocket Mortgage Rep the day after Thanksgiving. He was polite but not helpful so I asked for his Supervisor to call me.More",1
Jeff,"Carmichael, CA","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2021","I love working with Rocket Mortgage. You make the entire process painless. Andy was great, responsive, timely, and knowledgeable. The only piece of feedback I have is I somehow ended up in the queue again for refinancing calls and got call after call, after call from Rocket Mortgage asking me to refinance within a week after this one closed. I think this happened because I was on the app trying to see the payoff amount for the loan I was refinancing from, which triggered me to get back into the system thinking I wanted a refinance. This process should be cleaned up and cross-referenced with people who just refinanced less than a certain time threshold.",5

Meagan,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2021","I have gone through the mortgage process several time in my life. This is the only process I backed out of. The appraiser they hired compared my property to a different neighborhood/city. She also did not take into account lot sizes. I tried to argue the appraisal to no effect (first appraisal I have argued). I had to pull out of the loan. While I realize they hire the appraiser through a 3rd party, my application fee was refused to be refunded. There were several material errors in the appraisal not addressed. I spent two hours on the phone just trying to get to the appraisal review department before they sent an email refusing the refund. I will never use them again. I certainly did not hire the incompetent appraiser and as a single mom, having to pay for such a bad appraisal really hurts.",1

Every time I attempted to work with and resolve issues I had with Rocket no one would listen, understand, investigate and resolved. I was promised call backs that never happened. Finally I decide to just Refi with another company after 6 months. It cost me a bunch of money but well worth it. The list of issues I have are just too long to list here. The most concerning is they still owe me $3300 and after almost a month of not responding to me or working with me I am almost to the point that I am going to have to file a complaint against them. Mortgage servicing is highly regulated, I know it will not be good on their end if I go that route, anyone with any real knowledge at Rocket Mortgage would know that as well, however they won't you speak to anyone who knows anything or cares.",1

They felt that it wasn't their fault that the appraisal was not completed in a timely fashion and blamed COVID for the delay, but forgot the other story they told me the 2nd time the appraiser supposedly had to go out and they felt that they should not bear any responsibility in helping pay those additional costs accrued.

She kept in contact with us after we moved into the next phase of the process. Chris ** was our next contact and he was also understanding and helpful.

Thankfully my girlfriend thought of Rocket Mortgage and we gave them a try. Andrew was transparent, concise, and responsive. As I went through escrow, I was assigned to a specialist for each stage. I felt I had a whole team helping me through my first home. Their app is user friendly and they have tasks between me and Rocket Mortage. I would definitely recommend Rocket Mortgage to my friends.",5
Leonard,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed Oct. 21, 2021","Here's the issue. Rocket Mortgage outsources customer service to the customer. The applicant must do most of the work and if the customer isn't computer savvy and doesn't have a scanner, the process is work intensive and stressful. Plus, given that Rocket doesn't have branches and many employees, your rates are not much, if any, less than traditional lenders. Older mortgage seekers should steer clear of Rocket.",3
Jacqueline,"Newark, DE","Reviewed Oct. 21, 2021","Refinancing through Rocket was straightforward and seamless. We utilized the task lists extensively.

We were able to close in just under a week. The only hiccup was in getting the payoff amount from our previous lender. We ended up requesting it ourselves and having it faxed over. Not a bad mark on you. I have already recommended Rocket to friends thinking about refinancing their current loans.,5
Tamara,"Chugiak, AK","Reviewed Oct. 21, 2021",It was a good experience except for waiting way too long to close. I would suggest having at least a couple different title companies you work with when it comes to states that you know take longer. Mine was a refinance and it took longer than when I initially bought the place which had a few delays. Just a thought for future clients.,4
Carmela,"Tillson, NY","Reviewed Oct. 20, 2021","We had a great experience from start to finish. I couldn't believe how fast it was.

Melodi,"Somers, MT","Reviewed Oct. 15, 2021",We have a wonderful experience. It was fast easy and we couldn't be happier. We have been working with Navy Federal for over 9 months just to adjust terms on our VA loan to take advantage of lower rates. It was horrible. I so fed up after resubmitting same document for 4th time in same 20day period that I was ready to totally give up. I stumbled onto to the Rocket site and decided to give it a try.

Donna Kay,"Centerville, IN","Reviewed Oct. 15, 2021","Marcus and the rest of the team worked expediently to complete the refi process.

Debra,"Havana, FL","Reviewed Oct. 15, 2021",I had a great experience from beginning to end. Everyone from Rocket Mortgage ​was very helpful and knowledgeable.

Dannielle,"New Tazewell, TN","Reviewed Oct. 14, 2021","The process was pretty fast, but after the appraisal was completed, there was a mishap. The banker and I was supposed to have communication once the appraisal was done because I initially wanted more money on the loan so I could put into the house. He said because he doesn't get notified after the appraisals are done, I would have to wait 6 months to be able to do a cash out refinance before I could get what I originally wanted. So not happy about that. He didn't offer to fix it so, it may be something that he cannot do by the time I spoke to him on 10/6. Closed on home on 9/27.",2
William,"Bayou Vista, TX","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2021","Everything went smoothly. Communication was great. Overall a very good experience.

Aquilino,"Tuckahoe, NY","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2021","Very good rates, but most impressive service focus. Appraisal, closing and supporting documents were all processed on time. My seller was very eager to finalize and close quickly, and Rocket was key in being able to meet tight timelines. There are a number of appropriate follow-ups and surveys, all of which were recorded as stellar. I have and continue to recommend Rocket. My attorney at closing also emphasized how good Rocket has been recently with numerous other closings in which she was involved.",5
Lauren,"Glouster, OH","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2021","The process was so smooth from start to finish - it took almost no effort on my part, and every representative I spoke with was helpful and informative without any encounter taking up a ton of time. Love the online experience which was very user friendly, and I am so happy with the terms I received. My only regret is not doing it sooner. I was shocked to find I have paid as much in interest in the first 4 years of my previous 30-year home loan than I will pay in the 15 year life of my new loan with Rocket Mortgage.",5
Amanda,"Claremont, NC","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2021","This was my first time refinancing and Rocket Mortgage made it a breeze. I never had to leave my home, not a whole lot of back and forth, everything was organized and the whole process was smooth. Everyone was very friendly and professional.",5
Jeffry,"Coaldale, PA","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2021","Shortly after we first contacted Rocket Mortgage about doing a re-fi on our home to get a lower rate, we were immediately contacted by personnel who literally held our hand through the entire process - they answered all of our questions patiently and thoroughly - they helped us get through the mountain of paperwork associated with acquiring a mortgage - they really helped us to get a great interest rate, extra funds to pay off some existing debt; got us some extra cash to help with an upcoming wedding, and kept our monthly payment less than what we are paying now. It literally was the most painless and rewarding financial experience we have ever encountered. I would highly recommend Rocket Mortgage to anyone looking for their first mortgage or for those looking to do a re-finance.",5
Kathryn,"Garrett, IN","Reviewed Oct. 12, 2021","The time we applied to the time we closed was less than 30 days. The process was seamless due in large part to Rocket's exceptional online customer portal.

Thomas,"Saddle River, NJ","Reviewed Oct. 11, 2021","I have used them for another mortgage previously. This time it has been terrible. I have a tiny loan to value of less than 20%. If you include the insurance claim amount it would still be less than 20% thus no risk on their part. I had an insurance claim due to flood, insurance company included their name on the check and it has been impossible to get them/Rocket to send us the money. It's really terrible, they don't respond, they break their promises, they miss their own timelines, they bounce you around and take no accountability. I'm to the point I may just pay off the mortgage amount to be done with them. It's really been disgraceful.",1

Caitlin,"Albany, NY","Reviewed Oct. 9, 2021","My experience with Rocket Mortgage while refinancing my home was great. The process was very easy and my banker, Erin **, was helpful in starting the loan process and answering any questions. I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because the second half of my experience was not great. A promotion was supposed to be added, and when I inquired about it with several customer service reps and my bankers, they either did not know about it or provided completely conflicting information. The lack of knowledge on the part of rocket mortgage was disappointing, and long story short I did not get a promotion that would have been of great value to me after closing the loan. The mishandling of the situation and lack of any one willing to attempt to do something to fix the issue has honestly made me think I will go elsewhere for future mortgage needs when I purchase another home or refinance in the future.",4
Roxanne,"Black Mountain, NC","Reviewed Oct. 9, 2021","Please see my previous reviews. We were completely satisfied and impressed with the service we received. Waiting for the appraisal took longer than we expected which delayed the whole process about a month longer than was suggested. That was the only hitch.

Candace,"Toledo, WA","Reviewed Oct. 9, 2021","I would give 5 stars, but it seems like there were hidden fees in my loan. I was quoted a particular interest rate then charged for points to buy down to that rate, not cool... The only reason I didn't call the agent on it was that I wanted to get this done! It was finished in a timely manner.",4

Elizabeth,"Everson, WA","Reviewed Oct. 3, 2021","These folks are masters at bait and switch. They lured me into starting a refi saying there would be absolutely nothing out of pocket for me. Every time I we spoke it changed. I don't have the kind of money they now want to do it. They have constantly needed more. Conditions are expected yet I met everyone and then they still change the numbers. They don't have a current appraisal yet so they're using a 9 year old value and my property has more than doubled since then but that doesn't seem to hold any value. My basic gut instinct tells me I'm dealing with a smarmy ""loan agent"". So do yourself a favor and shop around. There are honest, decent people out there. Rocket is not. My existing lender is now doing my refi for nothing out of pocket. And coming up with a better payment.",1

Leo,"Warwick, RI","Reviewed Sept. 29, 2021",Rocket Mortgage sent my homeowners insurance to the wrong address. The money went back to escrow. They told me they would overnight it to the correct address but never made it. My insurance company told me my homeowners would expire. I have to use my credit card to pay my insurance. Rocket mortgage's investigation of this matter is in its 4th week. They should have refunded me my money and whenever they do recover these lost funds then they should keep that. Never again will I refinance or get a mortgage with rocket mortgage! A billion dollar company can't make good on my refund in a timely manner.,1

The Rocket Mortgage representative made a promise that she and her Director got the condo fee excluded prior to us making the application to refinance and then we made an application for the refinance which was approved.

When you try to get in touch with them they say “Oh well we are an autonomous. You find everything you need our our customer page”. No one calls or emails back for days. This was never told to us, neither was the fact that they charge $500 for an appraisal and then they tell you it will be done and back in 11 Days. That again is a lie.

Did not listen to what I asked for and I ultimately settled for a different loan in order to have the process finalized. Feel free to call me if you’d like. I’m happy with my home.

Brooke,"Gainesville, FL","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2021","When I first made inquiry about refinancing my home loan, I specifically asked about being able to reduce my monthly mortgage payment while still retaining my finance term of 15 years. I was told this could not be done. As such, I was looking to consult with another mortgage lender. Fortunately, a few weeks later, another agent contacted me asking about my earlier contact/inquiry. I explained to her ""what"" occurred. She then informed me that Rocket Mortgage could, indeed, handle the refinancing without changing my 15 year loan. This was wonderful news and as they say ""the rest is history."" I am very, very appreciative. Thank you.",5
Ryan,"Tualatin, OR","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2021","The process was very seamless and efficient. However, there are perceived concerns about security without the face to face interaction. It would improve the comfort of clients if you were very clear about who would be contacting them at the next stage. Have them provide proof of ID and contact info. Particularly for the in-person closing/signing where you use a third party notary. Overall it was a positive experience.",5

I never felt like I was figuring things out alone and any questions I had were answered fully and promptly.

I would recommend Rocket Mortgage to anyone and everyone.",5
Nicole,"Locust Grove, GA","Reviewed Aug. 27, 2021","The process to get preapproved was easy. Uploading the documents to the app was a breeze. It took a little longer than expected to close which stressed me out. I never really talked to my loan guy but once. Maybe I was talking to his team? I don’t know. I contacted them with an issue about my employment verification on a Monday and on Friday they still had not corrected the problem. That was a mess. I had to call over and over again for them to get the verification right. The appraisal wasn’t done right the first time and so I had to take off from work to meet the appraiser, again. And even after that, the appraisal still was missing key details. So, we had to wait on Amrock to get the appraisal fixed. That was a mess. I do enjoy the app on my phone though. That’s a plus! I’m just glad it is over. As long as nothing happens to the phone app, I’ll be good.",3

Brent,"Riverton, UT","Reviewed Aug. 26, 2021","You had a hard time getting the numbers right. They were not corrected until 30 minutes before closing. It appears that is a tactic to mess with clients by waiting to the last minute so when the client looks over the numbers they will miss something because of the time crunch. I feel as though you did not give me all of the credits that I had coming to me, but I did not have the time to completely examine the documents. You had to appraise the property two times because you ordered the wrong appraisal the first time and you charged me for both appraisals. What I suspect is that you added the cost for the wrong appraisal back in somewhere. The difference between the totals from the incorrect numbers and the correct numbers should have been somewhere around $700 but it was $500. I could not immediately see where the difference was, so I could not object.More",1

Michael,"Land O Lakes, FL","Reviewed Aug. 21, 2021","So from the beginning, refinance took too long. Was supposed to close beginning of July.

That was the first issue more the smaller of the two. Now this is the part that myself and your own banker had issues with. So this all started around mid July.

I only found out at the very end after applying, giving a credit report approval (which lowers my credit score when they check), uploading a ton of documents and meeting an appraiser that they would not underwrite my loan unless I change the title to my name. I paid an attorney to set up my titles according to financial planning needs and it is silly to change the title name and then change it back after a mortgage has been given. My advice is to ask first about the rules regarding LLC and Living Trust titles before you get too far down the road because they won't tell you until the very end after they have taken up a bunch of your time.",1

Antonio,"Charlotte, NC","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2021","From the first click through closing, this has been the ""BEST"" experience in my 30 years buying and selling several homes. The knowledge, follow up, clear concise direction and answers to questions were superb. I definitely would like to call out Justin ** and (I cannot find the name at the moment) who followed up on documentation, every touchpoint, and every person from Rocket Mortgage were confident and very knowledgeable - I remained highly confident reinforcing the feeling of a true partnership to a successful closing.",5
Amy,"Grand Blanc, MI","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2021","Chose Rocket Mortgage after a conversation with Sales Rep. Gerald. Since then, the process has been slow and disorganized. Months later, we still haven't closed, in spite of quick turnarounds on our end (requests for documents, etc.). Very hard to get questions answered in such a large company. ""I don't have that information"" is a common response. Too, the lending documents continue to change with ever-increasing numbers in the closing cost category. Wish we'd chosen a smaller company with personal representation.",1
Pamela,"Cooper City, FL","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2021","The experience was very positive. I had working on refinancing my home mortgage for several months with other companies, both were unsuccessful. From the moment I contacted Rocket Mortgage, the closing occurred approximately one month later. All parties during every step were very helpful and professional.",5
Tina,"Montgomery, IL","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2021",Cody was awesome to work with!! He took the time to answer all of our questions. The whole process was so easy and was fully complete in about a month. The app was easy to track our progress and complete our tasks.,5
Jerry,"Montgomery, TX","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2021","Best experience ever, no complaints about anything, Nikki my contact was the best ever, I would give her 100 stars. if I ever do another mortgage Rocket Mortgage will be the only company I will talk to.

Michael,"Fillmore, IN","Reviewed Aug. 9, 2021","I was contacted by Rocket to let me know they may be able to help reduce my interest rate on my loan. All information asked for was quick and to the point and I was able to do it all over the phone. Closing happened very shortly after loan approval and the closing took place in my home, which was great. A+ all the way. You will have my business in the future and you will be highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a purchase or a refinance. Thanks for watching out for me and my wife.",5
Kaye,"Monroe, GA","Reviewed Aug. 9, 2021",Thank you for a easy experience. We appreciated the efficiency & the quick turnaround. Very easy from start to finish. Questions answered & if not someone got back to us quickly. You made us feel like we were not dumb & felt appreciated.,5

Sarah,"Lockport, IL","Reviewed Aug. 5, 2021","For our first mortgage refi, incentives & lender credits dropped off, would have lost if I didn't fight for them. For our 2nd home, that was better but took almost 6 weeks to get appraisal completed. Everyone I worked with however was great and worked to help me out.",3
Bruce,"Oxford, CT","Reviewed Aug. 5, 2021","Overall very good but the rate and terms seemed to change frequently. It felt a bit like ""bait & switch."" (Went from 2.25% to 2.99%.) I know that's not the case, but that's how it felt. The closing instructions were somewhat confusing. I was told verbally to complete various forms electronically before the closing agent arrived. However, that was not the case. Indeed, we completed them all again once he arrived. It was not difficult. It was smooth but didn't match the expectation. I would recommend Rocket Mortgage again with the above cautions.",4
Dan,"Corolla, NC","Reviewed Aug. 3, 2021",My banker was very good. Client Relations were average and underwriting and closing was poor. This simple refinancing with you as original lender took over 56 days. You had appraisal in plenty of time. This refinancing should have taken 30 days at maximum.,3
Linda,"Sulphur Springs, TX","Reviewed Aug. 2, 2021",Everyone was nice and happy anytime we called in. In the beginning we thought the loan would have been faster. It took four months for the loan go through. Yes we will encourage people to visit Quicken Loans if they are looking for a loan. Thanks.,3
Amber,"Olive Branch, MS","Reviewed July 31, 2021",Excellent and prompt service. The process with closing was very quick and convenient and flexible with our work schedules.

Rocket closed us in less than 2 weeks. Online interactions very easy and their customer service was great - never an issue getting a live person, which is such a challenge these days.",5
Shawn,"Richmond, CA","Reviewed July 31, 2021","Everything started off fine. Since I was a previous client, the banker was able to access most of my existing info and get the loan application moving along quickly. He instilled confidence that we would be able to close in time and things would be expedited if necessary. All was well. Then the “assembly line” moved to the next person, and then another. Rather than have a trusting relationship with one person, I got shuffled around in a seemingly high-tech system that appeared well designed but then fell apart and almost scuttled my new home purchase.More",2

STAY AWAY!",1
Misti,"Lampasas, TX","Reviewed July 30, 2021",I would recommend Matt ** and the Rocket team to most anyone. The experience and process were simple and he was always helpful.

Scott,"Newberry, SC","Reviewed July 30, 2021","Whether intentionally or not, the person we worked with on our loan indicated that by making two loan payments a month instead of just one, we could reduce the payoff period from 30 years to around 16.

Wayne,"Waxhaw, NC","Reviewed July 29, 2021","Was much better than previous refinances I've had with other companies. Wife and I were very pleased.

Carol,"Salem, SC","Reviewed July 29, 2021",The entire process went as it should. We have a couple bumps but they were resolved. Everyone involved did a good job.

Marcus,"Van Buren Twp, MI","Reviewed July 28, 2021","Brady ** was great from the first day we discussed our Refi, he made it so easy from signing Doc to the Closing process.

John,"Clovis, CA","Reviewed July 27, 2021","This is my 3rd refinance through Rocket (Quicken). Each one was more streamlined than the last. This last one was smooth and seamless.

Changed alright!!! Rocket Mortgage pushed the closing cost up to $4,812, AND NO communication. This whole process has been dishonest, underhanded and a waste of time.",1
Diane,"Martinsburg, WV","Reviewed July 25, 2021","I highly recommend Quicken/Rocket Loans. The loan process was simple, easy and fast! We didn’t need an appraisal and we were closed within 3 weeks.

Vincent,"Holtsville, NY","Reviewed July 25, 2021",Too many different people involved in the process. They should let you know how many different people are involved and how many different departments you will have to deal with.

Sabina,"Kansas City, KS","Reviewed July 24, 2021","My experience went very smooth and easy. Everyone was very friendly, patient and helpful. They answered any questions I had and assisted me through the entire process. Thank you again Quicken Loans. I appreciate you all.",5
Arlene,"Orlando, FL","Reviewed July 23, 2021","I never applied but I was offered refinancing, this experience was not very good, a lot of miscommunication and the moment I have agreed to the refinancing I was left in limbo, not a very good thing to just keep asking the representatives, because they say different thing and if you don't read and research it yourself you end up hanging. If not for the delay team Mr Noah G. who has been very helpful to process my closing. Couple of reps when I called was not very helpful at all. I would not want to go through this kind of experience again in the future.",1

Vanesa,"Pawtucket, RI","Reviewed July 20, 2021","Quicken was referred to me by a family member, and I would certainly recommend to anyone. The process was smooth and easy, it was extremely convenient being able to load all of the documents online, and how the processing team communicated via text. Their responsiveness and willingness to support with any questions I had made the entire process painless. And on signing day, they had a notary come to my house, which was very convenient. My only feedback for improvement would be that sometimes I received calls or texts from other members of the team that I was not familiar with, and, since there are a lot of people working on different pieces, it felt like too many people to be in contact with sometimes.",5
computers,"Fredericksburg, VA","Reviewed July 20, 2021","I have purchased and had many home loans so I understand the process and know what questions to ask.

Timothy,"Seaside, OR","Reviewed July 16, 2021",Thank you for the opportunity to share in this review. When I first attempted to apply for a refinance I filled out the information online. My first contact was Mr. ** in Arizona. He was more than helpful in answering my questions. I believe I contacted him twice and was able to give precise answers to my questions. Then there was time during the process when I needed to contact the help desk to fix a incorrect setup on a form. They fixed almost instantly. They were more than patient and courtesy.,5
Mary,"Newark, OH","Reviewed July 16, 2021",Andrew and the rest of the team was amazing! I couldn’t have done this without their support and being there every step of the way! Andrew went above and beyond any lender me or my realtor has ever seen (she’s been in the business for 15 years)!,5

Greg,"Milwaukee, WI","Reviewed July 13, 2021","I started my refi with Rocket Mortgage, I filled the application and submitted all the documentation with Matilda the mortgage broker, She told me everything was fine and she had all the documentation needed. Next I got a call from Alex a loan consultation person from Quicken loans being very rude demanding more documentation or the loan will be denied. At this point I decided that I'm not going to be passed from one agent to another. A day later I got another call from Quicken loans agent asking me the same questions I was asked by the two previous agents. Rocket Mortgage or Quicken Loans make promises they can't keep and when they cant deliver you just got a ding on your credit file. Scam Scam Scam. If you can go directly to the mortgage company yourself cut out the middleman and save money.",1

Sandra,"Lockport, NY","Reviewed July 13, 2021","The initial customer service rep was awesome. The second customer service rep never returned my call and a third personal who contacted made me feel embarrassed of our financial situation when I asked her a questions. My understanding was that I was contacted by the second and third because my initial person was on vacation and they were helping out. Amrock appraisal person was ""ok"". He had to come back to take more pictures and seemed annoyed when I asked a question. The closing attorney was unprofessional, impatient, and rushed. He had another appointment scheduled 30 minutes from when ours started and he was rushed and upset because or our lack of tech knowledge. I offered several suggestions and he kept saying he doesn't have time. I couldn't wait for him to leave my house.",3
Jeffrey,"Wake Forest, NC","Reviewed July 13, 2021","Generally, I would rate all services as topnotch! My mortgage assistant was available at all times. There was one small communication glitch that I wish had been more clear. In this fast and furious market, I agreed on the minimum down payment required to move forward and then do a recast! I understood that the recast could be done immediately after closing! Then when I contact the processor to do the recast, he said no. That I had to wait for 2 monthly normal payments to be recorded! I have been a loyal customer for many years and found this to be a black mark. Anyway, I will abide by the request and then on 9/1 immediately request the recasting to be done.",5
Susan,"Lenexa, KS","Reviewed July 12, 2021","Overall wonderful service. Good people, well trained. The title closing made my day as they came to the house. The mortgage manager quickly addressed my concerns and sent real estimated of the cost.. This was a process as I considered another vendor.",5

Barbara,"Lawrenceville, GA","Reviewed July 8, 2021",Refinance of my loan was a great experience. The entire process from start to finish was approximately 2 weeks.

Jonathan,"Walled Lake, MI","Reviewed June 30, 2021","Everything with Rocket Mortgage went smoothly until the very end with the horrible title company. I’m not sure why you would use such a horrible company who makes your closing day delayed. Talk about the number of mistakes they did, they forgot the checks for the sellers. Then they overnighted them to the wrong address. A whole day later they managed to get the check to the sellers, and us the keys to our house. I had to cancel so many companies and actually switch my moving date because of their recklessness. If I was rocket mortgage, I wouldn’t let the final impression be such an unorganized company. It wreck two weeks of my plans and they supposedly sent me a gift card in the mail in which I never received. If you would like me to recommend rocket mortgage to others, I’d suggest switching your title company or refunding the money I gave them for closing costs, because they did not do their job in which my money was used for.

They were kind of snarky with me at times and also a member of my insurance team. We are still trying to get something resolved they were alerted to verbally and in writing to multiple times. There were other small issues with them as well on various part of the transaction.More",4
Mansoor,"Meadowsplace, TX","Reviewed June 15, 2021",How you could you pay off my escrow balance from my old loan which I was suppose to refunded. This was never disclosed nor got my consent. This is not fair for the customer. I have been the customer for Quicken Loans for more than 20 years. Very very disappointing experience this time.,1

Tammy,"Concord, CA","Reviewed June 13, 2021","I do not like that I can't automatically set up auto pay. I almost missed my first payment. All my other homes, I was able to set up auto pay immediately. Also, can't set it up until I have made a payment. The whole purpose is to avoid late payments. After, I make a one time payment, I have to wait to I set up auto payment. That increases the chance of missed payments. I should be able to ""Make One-Time Payment"" and set up auto payment for bi weekly with a start date, all at the same time. That is not hard. I can do that with the banks. If I try to set up auto payment, I will be making 2 monthly payments, in the same month, which I don't want to do. Now, I have to set another reminder to schedule auto payment. This is a mortgage company, should be able to handle payments.",3
Ryan,"Dearborn, MI","Reviewed June 10, 2021",Always fast and friendly. That’s pretty much what makes a difference these days. Not too many friendly companies out there!!!

Thanks for the great service.,5
Marty,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed June 10, 2021","The Rocket process and online portal worked very well. Our first point of contact, Bill **, was awesome. I cannot say enough good things about working with Bill. Our real estate agent and attorney both had positive things to say about working with Bill. Everyone we communicated with and talked to at Rocket was focused on getting the loan closed. Very happy with the experience and I would recommend Rocket to others.",5
Edward,"Stone Mountain, GA","Reviewed June 9, 2021",This process was stress-free and straightforward. Zach who I worked with was knowledgeable and made sure the process was seamless.

LAQUISHA,"Moreno Valley, CA","Reviewed June 8, 2021","I decided to see what Rocket had to offer. My mistake. When I got my loan quote. I paid a 500$ deposit. Now this should have been a red flag because I’ve never had to pay a good faith deposit before on any mortgage loan. The loan officer said he got me a great deal. 3.1 interest but at what cost? They deceptively presented a loan that included over 4% interest buy out points, This was never explained. People if you're gonna pay points then understand you will pay more interest in the life of the loan. Why not just present a loan without points if you were really trying to help. So 24hr later I decided to turn down their offer so now I have been told I will get a refund of my 500$. But that never happened. So not only do they present their loans like it’s a deal but are charging points instead of basic low interest loans. They steal your good faith deposits. They said I will get my deposit back on may 26th. It’s June 8. Still no refund.",1
Kenneth,"Oregon, OH","Reviewed June 8, 2021","Completely positive experience from beginning to end. I reached out for assistance via an online inquiry which resulted in a text conversation leading to the supplying of electronic documents. The application, approval, and closing was all completed in under 30 days with only 3 people involved from the mortgage company. The only hard copy were the closing documents a large portion of which actually were electronic. I give Rocket the highest recommendation.",5

Joseph,"Lenoir, NC","Reviewed June 4, 2021","Overall, good experience. I liked the primarily digital uploads and “portal.” The people I dealt with were nice, professional and understanding. My annoyance came with the vast amount of document submissions. It felt like the whole system is set up for “two W2s and done”. As a small business owner, I felt there was SO much verification of income, assets, etc., that wouldn’t have been necessary for regular employed people. A “small business owner” focused representative team would be helpful and help streamline the process. Otherwise, very happy. Will definitely use QL again if I ever refinance or buy.",4
Cristian,"Taylor, PA","Reviewed June 3, 2021",Excellent service. Everyone was very professional and helped with everything we needed. Always on time and available for us.

Gary,"Robbinsville, NJ","Reviewed May 25, 2021",Our experience was more than we could have hoped for.

We would certainly use Quicken again in the future and recommend to others.",5
Michelle,"Santa Paula, CA","Reviewed May 20, 2021","The process was quick and easy. Because we were existing customers, it was even easier.

Imke,"Durham, NC","Reviewed May 19, 2021","One would expect that your experts know their field of expertise really well, however neither the case worker nor the insurance expert gave the impression they know what they are doing. After we provided already bad feedback we got contacted by you but did not an assurance service will be improved but just excuses about employees being overworked. The latter is your problem not ours and an indication you take on too many cases indicating bad business practices. I would not recommend you for future services.",2
Wayne,"Murrieta, CA","Reviewed May 19, 2021","I was really impressed with Rocket Mortgage during the first 3 weeks of the process. Our loan officer was very prompt and checked in with us almost daily throughout the information and document gathering process. I would give this company 5 stars, but after our paperwork went to Underwriting and Closing, communication dropped off and our file was delayed. Our Escrow company even quit the file over not being able to communicate with closers. We ended up having to go through Rocket's in-house Escrow company to get it done. All in all - first 3 weeks were fantastic. Once it went to underwriting and closing I give it 1 star (it took 5 extra weeks once it went to Underwriting and Closing).",3

Brian,"Traverse City, MI","Reviewed May 17, 2021",I started trying to refinance in mid January and we finally got it done at the end of April. I would try to find my own appraiser as the first one assigned never contacted me and never answered me when called. The second was a mess and totally low-balled the appraisal. Halfway through they changed my contact person with Quicken. I had to get directly involved in solving an issue with the subordination process or the loan would have never happened. All in all a lot more work and struggle than I would have expected.,2

No need to write a check (who still writes them in this day of age) or spend $10 dls on a money order to pay $3 (yes that’s BOFA for you no ACH). Rates were just as competitive if not better.

I told him I was not interested because I did not want any credit inquiries. He said it was a soft inquiry and would have very little impact. I agreed. Then he pulled both me and my husband’s credit.

Amanda,"Painesville, OH","Reviewed April 30, 2021","I was thrilled with the process of closing my loan. I was able to upload all documents within the first 24 hours without any issues, and the whole process went super fast. I called a few times about questions I had on the paperwork and someone was able to take my call right away and answer them. Everyone was so nice and professional. Even the initial quoting process was great because the person negotiating the loan terms was doing what was best for us. They didn’t push us to take cash out, they simply listed our options and asked us for our feedback on what would work best for our lifestyle. I am so happy we went with Rocket Mortgage. I also love the online site because it’s super easy to use and I already scheduled for additional payments to my principal each month with no hassle.

Unfortunately my experience with them is one of the worst. After prequalifying, explaining our debt, getting a no problem were all good from the lender, sold my house and started the new home buying process. Finally found a new home, and it went downhill from there. Almost everything this company has said has been a lie. They can't qualify, I need to pay down more debt, I have done everything they have asked and every day there is a new hoop to jump through. Every day the numbers changed. I even got a call from someone claiming to be a senior vice president threatening me not to spend ANY money, still in limbo and it's a nightmare. Biggest liars ever. They have given me PTSD and I NEVER EVER EVER want to purchase another house. I would rather rent than go through this with someone again.",1

Tracy,"Clovis, NM","Reviewed April 18, 2021","Great customer service, the process is easy, and quick closing. VERY expensive closing costs that take almost 4 years to pay before you're actually paying on the mortgage. Shop around to find lower closing costs. Sometimes miss items that are current such as the surveys or appraisals which add extra costs to closing which is frustrating.",2
William,"Mi  Northville, MI","Reviewed April 17, 2021","Very, courteous and prompt and easy to work with.

Jacalyn,"Blue River, CO","Reviewed April 17, 2021","We refinanced and it went as smoothly as expected. Some hiccups, but those are always expected. Overall I would recommend them.

When I was struggling to upload documents, they called me and walked me through it.",4
Debra,"Chesterfield, MO","Reviewed April 16, 2021","Rocket Mortgage worked to get me a great rate, worked with my existing mortgage lender and explained the difference in a way that I could understand.

He had his original mortgage with them, and was actually contacted with an offer to refinance, and expressed his overall satisfaction with the company to me. My wife and I had previously attempted to refinance a year ago through some mortgage company that she had found and the experience was less than stellar. After going through the process and spending around $500 dollars, we were told that our home would not even appraise for our original selling price, and that there was no option other than to try again at a later time. Of course the agent who worked on our account was gone from the company when my wife reached out to them.More",5

Kenneth And Karen,"Jamestown, NC","Reviewed April 13, 2021","We have been customers for many years and have refinanced a few times. I was always impressed and have sent you customers over the years with my recommendations. However, this time, refinancing two homes was one disappointment after another. First of all I wanted to do both refinances at the same time but they landed up being 2 weeks or more apart. Secondly, information requested was ridiculous since we were already good customers and you had all of our information, including if we were Americans or had Green Cards. Rates were higher than I thought based on currently available rates at other banks.More",2

Christopher,"Rock Creek, OH","Reviewed April 11, 2021",I was originally messing around and thought I would see if I could get pre approved and sure enough I did. From start to finish it was easy. If I had a question someone always got back to me with a quick answer. My wife and I are extremely happy with the service and the layout of the app for uploading docs. With me being in Iraq and my wife at home we thought this would be extremely stressful but it was a great experience for us first time home buyers.,5

Jennifer,"Rome, GA","Reviewed April 9, 2021","Quicken Loans started out as just a question and turned into a wonderful experience of purchasing my first home. Everyone I talked to was very informative and very pleasant. They truly made my experience stress-free. They even called to check on me as an individual during the process and asked me if I had questions. They gave me prompt answers and I never had to 2nd guess anything I had to do or complete. I would highly recommend for anyone to use Quicken Loans. It was easy, fast and very professional.",5
Miko,"Litchfield Park, AZ","Reviewed April 8, 2021","Aaron ** with Rocket Mortgage was attentive, helpful, and most importantly available. I was able to do most of my loan application online, through the website or app. Communication was near constant, even taking into account different time zones.

Kaila,"Conshohocken, PA","Reviewed April 7, 2021","Rocket Mortgage really went above and beyond our expectations. As first time homebuyers, my husband and I were so scared.

We'll definitely recommend them to our friends and family!",5
Gerry,"Frankfort, IL","Reviewed April 5, 2021","Quick and simple, and very helpful people. Online processing was easy.

Jennifer,"Midwest City, OK","Reviewed April 5, 2021","Rocket Mortgage made my remortgage quick and easy. One of their representatives reached out to me to let me know they could offer a lower rate. I had recently had a pay increase, so now I also had the option to refinance at a 15 year term instead of the original 30 year I had, so now I will be able to pay several thousand less over the long term in interest and fees. Very satisfied at how easy it was to manage everything from my end.",5
William,"Johns Island, SC","Reviewed April 3, 2021","For the most part the process went smoothly. However, 2 issues stand out which marred the closing. In the first, I submitted paperwork and placed phone calls indicating I was not required to have Flood Insurance. For some reason, the issue was not addressed and I had to fix it post closing. The second issue continues to confound me. In short, I was refinancing my house and removing my ex-wife from the deed. I had also set up a trust that the house was going into. A individual I spoke with, at Amrock, said they were only set up to handle removing my ex-wife. He said I had to hire an attorney to put the house into the pre-established trust. I subsequently discovered that was not true, the house could have very easily been taken care of as I wanted, and I would have saved myself $25 and 2 hours of time.",3
Elizabeth,"Tiffin, OH","Reviewed April 1, 2021",The experience was easy! Everyone we dealt with was very helpful and nice. The app made the process very easy to do as well. The process was also very quick and required minor work on our part to complete. Would recommend to anyone.,5

I saved boatloads of money and the total amount of my personal time it took from start to finish, including all calls interactions, forms filled out, etc. was under two hours. I also want to make it clear that my loan handler, Matthew was the ONLY reason I ended up going with Rocket Mortgage. He made it happen for me. Thanks Matthew!",5

Ernest,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2021","After much thought and reflection I finally decided to go ahead do a refinance. The process was mostly streamlined and Carter was an excellent loan officer. I guess the current market conditions pushed the process out farther than my past refis, but I am totally happy with the results. Considering the pandemic I had reservation about the closing and meeting with an agent in person, but it would up being a reasonably pleasant and a hybrid closing with most of the documents being signed digitally and only a few wet signatures in person. Overall a B+ experience since the process took 2 months.",4

Michael,"Parsippany, NJ","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2021","My experience with refinancing my mortgage has been awful. The customer service I have received has been deplorable and the constant reminder of how great your customer service is, is an outright lie. Actually, I was lied to on three different occasions during this process once from my loan officer, David **, once from the closing team, and once from Julia **. You have recorded lines so you can review this complaint and see that what I am saying is accurate. As it stands now, I cannot be someone who refers others to Quicken mortgage.

Michael,"Amherst, OH","Reviewed Feb. 22, 2021","I was misled and given incorrect information through the entire process. The process drag out over 4 months. Unacceptable. I was told that a 5000 forbearance amount from my old loan was rolled into my new loan. Upon going through the closing documents that was not true. It was tacked on to the end of the loan. This would have stopped the loan in its tracks had you been honest. I was told all expenses would be rolled into the loan, not true. At closing I had to pay 1600 out of pocket for taxes and insurance. Both of which had already been paid. It took me talking to 4 different people before even getting someone who could help me. Now that I did I am at the mercy of the incompetent county government I live on to return my money. I would not recommend Rocket mortgage to anyone. Very dishonest and getting in contact with people who know how to fix a problem is nearly impossible.",1

Jacqueline,"Ann Arbor, MI","Reviewed Feb. 19, 2021","Overall the experience was good. There were parts of the refinance that seemed to drag on rather than being efficient. For example, there was the need to contact my insurance ""agent"". In most national companies like USAA, you don't have a specific ""agent"" that you work with. QL didn't seem to get that. They also required information that I could and eventually did provide for them by giving them my policy documents. There was quite a go around with them needing to talk to my agent but USAA not wanting to talk to them without me. QL also wanted me to give out my PIN and other confidential info so that they could access my account. In the end, they got none of this but processed what they needed with my policy. They could have saved me a lot of my time and hassle.",4

Jessica,"Madison, NY","Reviewed Feb. 17, 2021","I am happy with the overall experience we (my husband and I) had. Representatives were quick to assist us and answer our questions/concerns. We were kept informed of the process most of the time and communication was great between us and representatives. However, at one point we were repeatedly delayed in closing on the house due to a lack of communication between the other parties (sellers lawyer, sellers agent) and it took several attempts and weeks to obtain an update. There was a lot of phone tag. I do not feel that Quicken Loans was entirely responsible, so you may not have to do anything to improve, but you may wish to keep a record if it happens again to warn other customers of possible delays when dealing with specific companies. Regardless, we will keep quicken loans in high consideration if we require any future loans.",4

Delna,"Bethesda, MD","Reviewed Feb. 16, 2021",The process we really easy and great communication with loan agent. The only part we did not enjoy was working with the appraiser. The appraiser handled the refinance as if we were purchasing a new home and did a home inspection. The refinance we much less than the value of the house and yet we were forced to fix planks on a deck. This was disappointing and a hassle that did not add any value to the home. Just wasted our money since the deck is going to be removed. This did make me rate the experience three stars instead of five stars. The main reason for removing two stars was the waste of time (time is money) and the money spent for a useless activity and there was no recourse. We either had to fix it or go to a different loan company.,3

Franz,"Orlando, FL","Reviewed Feb. 11, 2021",The process was easy once everything was aligned and online application was very user friendly. Only reason for not giving 5 stars was my refi kept getting passed around to different people and got way too many phone calls throughout the process.

Since this was an outside agency I do not blame my Quicken team.

After missing an incredibly small window to close in September (one day!) due to my wife being out of town, we were told that we needed to resubmit almost all documents, and it was again months until we heard anything else. At this point, I should have ended the process, but I tend to be a pretty loyal person, so I stuck with it. In the end, we closed in the middle of January after almost 8 months.

Felix,"Takoma Park, MD","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2021",The entire refinancing experience was quick and seamless. The agents assigned to process my application were exceedingly helpful and informative. The closing process was very simple and sensitive to the extraordinary health concerns and restrictions we currently face. We were particularly pleased with the convenience of the amount of actions we could take from our home from the initial submission of our application to the final closing and the convenience of the guidance and advice we were able to obtain throughout the process.,5
Neil,"Virginia Beach, VA","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2021",Everything was going great. The only complaint I have is that the appraisal fee was supposed to be waived. During closing scheduling it was found it was not credited back to us. I was told it would delay closing by several days. We could not wait. I was the told it would be requested that a check be mailed to us with the refund. That would be great but I can no longer get an update on that. Very frustrating!,4
Linda,"Fort Mill, SC","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2021","Once I got the hang of doing everything digitally, it was a piece of cake. Snapping a photo of documents and sending them to a central account was quick. Downloading documents from accounts on line was simple. The dashboard of the loan site has everything I will need in one well organized location using one password and it will save me time in the future. You are the ""Chic-Filet-A"" of mortgages!",5
Cindy,"Grants Pass, OR","Reviewed Jan. 23, 2021","This is the second time we've turned to Quicken Loans to refinance our mortgage. Both experiences were effortless. While our bank of twenty years stalled and stalled for 7 months, constantly requiring new financial data and explanations of deposits as the old information was always, conveniently outdated, Kenny in Arizona, after a mere hour phone call, assured us we could close in a matter of weeks despite two federal holidays in the middle of the time frame. We applied with our bank in June. Crickets throughout the year. We applied with Kenny and Quicken Dec. 22 and signed Jan. 7th! That's top notch in my book! Thank you Rocket Mortgage! You were in warp speed on this one!More",5
Ravi,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Jan. 23, 2021","Process was very slick, streamlined & easy. Mostly online and regular follow up. Customer Service was superb & closing process was very painless. I found the costs to be higher than other mortgage lenders. Too many ""add ons"" in the closing costs though they were appropriately disclosed to me. I didn't have the time to shop around and would suggest you compare with others around the closing costs. You may save a few thousand.",5
Manuel,"Lake Worth, FL","Reviewed Jan. 23, 2021","When I decided to get a refinance for my home, Mr. ** made the process as clear and easy as possible.

Frank,"Corona, CA","Reviewed Jan. 22, 2021","When I first applied I spoke with somebody and their communication wasn't the best. They took a long time to respond and my questions weren't clearly answered. So I decided to shop around a little bit and was ready to move forward with another lender and then rates were beginning to dip so I thought I would reach out once more to Quicken. This time I was greeted by Dimitry and she was much more pleasant and helpful. She was able to get me a lower rate that I was originally quoted and she was able to get our PMI removed. She was also able to get all of our closing costs put into the loan so we didn't have to come out of pocket at all. After that, it seemed as the process just flew by and our loan was closed. At the end of it all we got a great rate and lowered our payment significantly.",4

Jeff,"Rockville, MD","Reviewed Jan. 20, 2021","Rocket Mortgage quoted a very good rate, but refused to say if it was 0 points until they checked credit report. I asked given my score of 800 if that was 0 points, but they refused to say. They only said they were very competitive. I finally relented and allowed credit to be pulled. They then said it was 3 points!!! That's not competitive at all. Also, they pulled my credit score twice, once by Rocket and once by some affiliate, which will reduce my credit score for the next two years.",1

Richard,"The Villages, FL","Reviewed Jan. 19, 2021",I liked your ease of application and the ability to talk to one salesperson. It became confusing when different people would contact me in arranging the loan. Also some of the information requests in my Rocket Mortgage Account were confusing. Example-This is a joint mortgage with my wife but the autopay set up only allowed one name. Another example - this request for feedback made me type in my profile when you should already have it. Also it said order number. Does that mean loan number? Net. Getting the loan was easy. Communicating with you is harder. And I want ONE customer service rep by name. Regards **,4

Susan,"Henderson, NV","Reviewed Jan. 14, 2021",Closing of refinance on December 28th 1:30 pm. I asked notary how long it would take. He said 20 minutes. Computer work alone was alone 20 minutes. Paper signing 35 more minutes. Notary did not want us to social distance. I had chairs set up to do that. He moved his chair closer to my husband at the table and finally agree I could sit 6ft away.

Donald,"Nampa, ID","Reviewed Jan. 9, 2021","I started a home refinance loan with Rocket Mortgage and gave them a $250 deposit and was lied to already on the phone. I was quoted a 2.75% loan rate but was Not told that it had been a real 2.9% rate that would cost me $1,750 in debt to buy down to the 2.75% rate! This is a bad practice they use to up all the fees and rates, I finally was given the estimate sheet that showed it all, most likely should have demanded this first but it's all part of the pressure ploy used online to bait people in. I watched free online tutorials about refinancing homes and got more educated in this whole process and cancelled my loan both in writing and verbally! To get back my deposit I had to have my Visa card get involved as Rocket stalled, but I was able to only have to pay $76 for a credit search that they did 3 days consecutively for no good reason, found that from the Bank I went to getting a Real Loan! Avoid this group!",1

Janine,"Gardiner, NY","Reviewed Jan. 6, 2021",Overall it was a good experience. Just a few frustrating moments with getting closing answers at the end.

Carl,"Chatlotte, NC","Reviewed Jan. 5, 2021",Took 120 days to close a refi even being a current client. Then the payoff checks came too late to payoff 0% interest credit cards that they knew was up in the beginning of the year.

I guess the only iffy thing was our appraisal. We had one and there was some question about a parcel one and two. Should the appraisal have gone up after including the second parcel. I did email about this and accepted the answer but maybe should have called. My fault on not following up better. Appraisals are also subjective and that is the nature of the business.

I don't think we would've closed that soon if it hadn't of been for the guy covering for Rob over the Thanksgiving Holiday (Darrick). He was GREAT!

I was asked to submit the same documents on multiple occasions, and once was even asked to submit my ex-husband's bank statements!!! All I needed was a small loan use for a remodel and luckily I had the time to wait, but if I ever decide to get financing in the future I will try for someone local who actually has a face....",2
Jourdan,"Alpharetta, GA","Reviewed Dec. 16, 2020","The initial evaluation was great and timely, after that things went down hill. It took three months for the refinance to get processed and the delays caused us to lose money that we were due back at closing. Further, we had to reschedule the closing because the initial closing did not have my wife, despite RocketMortgage having pulled her credit and mine, on the loan itself. The reason I am ranking 3 stars instead of 1 is because after all of these mess ups we were still able to close before the start of the new year and the customer service in dealing with these issues was great--very knowledgeable and responsive. However, the mess ups should never have occurred to begin with.",3
Joseph,"Sugar Hill, GA","Reviewed Dec. 16, 2020","I think that Quicken included a lot closing cost/fees that were excessive. My interest rate was also higher than the market. For those reasons, I will not use Quicken again or refer my friends. It is sad Quicken did this to me and others.",1

The second time, the lenders (probably since it was either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae gov't programs-which I had no idea was where you were getting the money from or I would have immediately stopped the process and gone with someone like Wells Fargo or my bank).More",2
Jeffery,"Oakdale, CA","Reviewed Dec. 8, 2020","I can't tell you how easy this process was. Everything was done very professionally and in a timely manner. Uploading my documents was simple, receiving new documents to sign was very prompt and the whole process was simplified by their smartphone app. I could log in at any time and see where I was at in the process. Scheduling the closing was fast and I couldn't be happier with the rate that I got. THANKS!",5
STEVEN,"Pleasant Valley, NY","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2020","Recently refinanced our second home with Rocket Mortgage. Knowledgeable staff and a very organized process for refinancing. I was a little disappointed with closing cost. Of course, I was aware of the cost prior to my closing but recently spoke with a family member who went with another company to refinance due to the cost difference and lower refinance charges.",4
Kristine,"Lucerne Valley, CA","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2020",This is the 2nd or 3rd time I've refinanced my home with Rocket Mortgage. I am extremely pleased with the service and am very happy with my new mortgage payment!! Nick was especially patient and helpful when the process began.,5
Bryan,"Macon, GA","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2020","The team from Quicken Loans was amazing. From start to finish, they helped us understand what we needed to do and what order to do things in. With this being the first home we've bought, we couldn't be happier with the service and dedication that was given to us.",5
Kristen,"Circleville, NY","Reviewed Dec. 6, 2020","Fast easy process, good customer service. Loved being able to do everything online. Would recommend to family and friends. Prepping for closing was easy and done at our convenience. Robert our contact was well informed and gave us practical options.",5
Gerald,"Henrico, VA","Reviewed Dec. 5, 2020",My experiences with Rocket Mortgage have always been exactly what I wanted. They were quick and direct with how I needed to proceed and forthcoming with information to assist me with my decision. Each loan advisor has been professional and a pleasure to work with throughout the process. The closing agents have been neat and professional and extremely knowledgeable and informative about the process.,5
Kelley,"Auburn Twp, OH","Reviewed Dec. 5, 2020","We closed in 30 days as scheduled, despite the climate and market conditions! ROCKET Mortgage said they would make it happen and THEY DID! We were quoted by other banks, anywhere between 30 and 60 days to close amid the current COVID conditions. Every person on the team was super patient and helpful with all questions and concerns throughout the process. I would not hesitate to recommend Rocket to family and friends!",5
Tom,"Highlands Ranch, CO","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2020",Excellent! Hard to believe you made the process so easy. We started the process after dinner one evening at 8pm. 90 minutes later we were done. Our loan coordinator Noah was great. Every step was easy to understand and execute.,5
Mary,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2020",Each of my Quicken representatives were knowledgeable and demonstrated great customer service - every step of the way.

Ashley,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2020",I had a great experience with Travis and his team. I felt they all were working very hard and kept me informed on the entire process.

David,"Manchester, MA","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2020","The Quicken Team was once again excellent in getting me through a refinance.

Great service.",5
Marquita,"Running Springs, CA","Reviewed Dec. 3, 2020","With crazy low interest rates, I decided to re-fi an investment property. After the loan cleared, I decided to re-fi our primary residence, too. Since, I applied within 30 days, all the paperwork from the first loan process was able to transfer to the new loan! Yeah! Less paperwork to deal with on my end! Rocket Mortgage has been very friendly and helpful. And, their website is easy to access, navigate and utilize for uploading paperwork. I highly recommend.",5
Manuel,"Pahoa, HI","Reviewed Dec. 3, 2020",I would like to express my gratitude to my broker Joe. As he was very knowledgeable and professional.. I would certainly do it again! I informed him of what I was wanting and he and Quicken came through. Before Quicken I had actually gone to a few lenders with my expectations who did not them so I was hesitant when I reached out to Quicken. Thank you again for helping us save on our mortgage!! Mahalo!!!,5
Dan,"Brooklyn, NY","Reviewed Dec. 3, 2020","Timely and repetitive with documents that were needed, bad communication. Closing almost didn't happen because of documents not sent to the processor in a timely manner. Multiple people call concerning closing with conflicting information. Did not get notified when new documents were required- was told we should be checking the website daily.",2
Ruby,"South Daytona, FL","Reviewed Dec. 3, 2020",First loan in April 2020 went amazingly smooth. My rep was amazing and proactive. The refi was not so smooth and my rep was difficult to get in touch with and did not seem to be as organized as my first rep. I was able to get answers by going around the rep but it would have been nice if he was proactive during the process.,3
Samuel,"Austin, TX","Reviewed Dec. 3, 2020",First experience was some pushy ex used car salesman. Really pissed is off. Then COVID hit and we were being pushed into doing the appraisal. Then I get an email to the wrong person talking about my payment is coming up. We will let you know when we are ready to move forward.,2
Olga,"Weston, FL","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020","This may have been the longest refinancing I've ever seen without a reason. The 'review' process took roughly two months and all I would get as an explanation is UW is reviewing it but nothing would be updated. Everything that was promised about closing date, pay off date, and regular updates was never completed. It was ridiculously annoying to have to call EVERYDAY to at least get the loan moving.",1
Alex,"Cleveland, TN","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020","Our work with Rocket Mortgage through Quicken Loans was breezy. From the start, our loan officer, Toni, was personable and easy to work with. She was excited with us as we walked through the process. From there, once we finalized a purchase offer and worked towards closing, our purchase specialist was helpful, though not necessarily as intentional. He did help us ensure we had the proper paperwork finalized, however, and we are grateful for the whole Quicken team for all of their support!",4
Micheal,"Lavaca, AR","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020",Our experience was great! Quick and easy. We were able to see each step of the process and what was being done behind the scenes. Totally easy uploading documents needed as well. We would definitely recommend using them if you are in the market for a purchase or a refinance.,5
Cody,"Rigby, ID","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020","My experience with everyone at Rocket was great. They made it quick and easy, and answered all my questions.

Charudatta,"Belle Mead, NJ","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020",Outstanding Service and great experience working with Quicken/Rocket Mortgage group. The online refinancing navigation/platform is very good and whole process was extremely swift. The Loan officer was very friendly and answered all my questions and concerns. And helped find appropriate refinancing option suitable for my needs.,5
Matthew,"Virginia Beach, VA","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020","From the beginning I was clear with my agent, Ryan **, via phone and email that I wanted to pay for all closing costs upfront and not have them rolled into the new loan amount. We discussed this at least three times. The loan amount was $10,000 more than the payoff amount. I asked to have it corrected and the loan went back to the underwriter delaying closing for a month. They came back with nearly the same amount a month later and I closed because I didn’t want to delay further. This is either complete distinction on the part of your organization or an utter disregard for the wishes of your customers on something as fundamental as the loan amount.",1
Mel,"South Abington Township, PA","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020",The staff was very friendly and helpful - they had a real desire to help and make things easier for the customer. The people were professionals & competent. They knew what they were doing and communicated well. Vey few snags along the way.,5
Michelle,"Merrimack, NH","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2020","I refinanced my mortgage and was pleasantly surprised by how quick, easy and informative Rocket Mortgage was.

I will definitely consider them going forward for other loans.",5
Michael,"Jacksonville, FL","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2020",Process was quick and easy. No surprises or tricks. I received exactly what I bargained for. Can you please send some consultants to Comcast and show those morons who to treat a customer? Everyone we dealt with was polite and professional. The deal only took a few weeks to go through. I appreciate the simplicity of it.,5
David,"North Windham, CT","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2020",Towards the end of the buying process it took way too long to go over some things about the house that were already explained by the real estate agent. And the mortgage person was not listening to the real estate agent. And I still have not received any type of payment booklet to send out the mortgage payments.,3
James,"Roswell, GA","Reviewed Nov. 30, 2020","Rocket Mortgage was very user friendly in getting the process to refinance started to its completion. I was immediately contacted by a representative. Other refinance companies responded a week or so after contact, Rocket Mortgage was within 30 minutes. The checklist was very helpful and made the process easy to complete.",5
Scott,"Bonney Lake, WA","Reviewed Nov. 30, 2020",Going through the mortgage process with Quicken Loans is about as seamless and simple as I could imagine!

Kendall,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed Nov. 30, 2020",My husband & I were very pleased with the entire refinancing process thru Rocket Mortgage.

Robert,"Roselle Park, NJ","Reviewed Nov. 28, 2020",Dealing with all the individuals was a pleasure. Everyone was was knowledgeable and pleasant. To see how much the closing cost was was a little shocking. People are in need of money and to see that much come out for closing cost was unsettling.,4

John,"Wallace, NC","Reviewed Nov. 28, 2020","Thank you for the explanation for the new investor of my loan although I have no idea of who the individual or what agency is at this point.

They have won our business for life!",5
Dion,"Shelby Township, MI","Reviewed Nov. 28, 2020","This was our second refi with Quicken Loans. Top notch experience -- easy and fast, no hassles, no bait-and-switch.

Matthew,"Perkasie, PA","Reviewed Nov. 28, 2020","There are many finance companies from whom you can get a low rate. Quicken was definitely the best finance company we have ever dealt with.

Richard,"Cherry Hill, NJ","Reviewed Nov. 27, 2020","When initially thinking to do this the sensation of being overwhelmed was at the forefront of our minds.

Shawn,"Payson, UT","Reviewed Nov. 27, 2020","We were pleasantly surprised at the process and ability to manage a Home Mortgage refinance through Quicken Loans. The computer distance managing of the process was impressive, the communication was excellent. The process was made easier. We appreciate how it was handled. However, We have one improvement to mention. The Costs of the refinance was high. Those closing costs could be a lot less. Now we are $6k more in debt after working so hard to pay our previous mortgage down. So, please think of the homeowner, and get those closing costs lowered. Thanks.",5
Johnny,"Stone Mountain, GA","Reviewed Nov. 26, 2020","Great experience, closed quickly because of convenient, easy App. No recordings, all calls answered with helpful information.

Eugene,"Florence, AZ","Reviewed Nov. 26, 2020","Process was very easy. Loan officer went out of their way to help. Communication was awesome. And the time to actually close the loan was very fast. Compared to another agency I was trying to work with, Rocket did an awesome job.",5
Garland,"Suffolk, VA","Reviewed Nov. 26, 2020","I did at closing. I don't remember her name but she was on time and completely prepared. This was a refi and it took a few weeks longer to close but I blame that on COVID pandemic. Overall, good experience.",5

Only thing was 30-45 days to closing-took longer-but duh-got pandemic. Everything promised-was fulfilled. We are very, very pleased. Thanks to everyone involved.

BRAND,"Ojai, CA","Reviewed Nov. 25, 2020",Terrible experience with them. Supposed to be a simple refi. We already had our loan with them. Every month resubmit bank statements. Every 3 months new profit and loss. Day of closing resubmit everything again.,1
Natalie,"Pingree Grove, IL","Reviewed Nov. 25, 2020","We worked with Brian ** and he was amazing! He was responsive, helpful, and thorough in every step of the process.

Amy,"Temple, GA","Reviewed Nov. 24, 2020",The process to refinance our mortgage was very easy and took the amount of time that was estimated. I would highly recommend to anyone seeking better rates on their mortgage! Not only did we get a lower rate but we will also pay off our mortgage 5 years earlier than the original loan.,5
Adam,"Wilmington, NC","Reviewed Nov. 24, 2020",Great experience from beginning to end of process. Highly recommend! Very friendly customer service and always quick to respond to any concern I had. I wasn’t familiar with processing a mortgage entirely online but I’ll never do it differently again!,5
Mark,"Corpus Christ, TX","Reviewed Nov. 24, 2020",Refi process took too long for existing customer... Should’ve been a slam dunk!!! Just like the survey always asking for more info when it’s not needed when you had all my information on file... You just need to make it easier for your existing customers moving forward.,3
Rodger,"Sunrise, FL","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2020",I am glad that everything worked out! I want to shout out all who were involved for doing such a professional and fantastic job getting this Refi done as quickly as possible! This was such a thorough and detailed process that took time but in the end we were successful.,5
Emily,"Richmond, TX","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2020","Hello, overall the experience was good but the process was significantly delayed because there seemed to be a lot of confusion around how to approach my maternity leave. Good news is that the delay resulted in a further drop in the interest rate of my refinance. My goal was to reduce the amount of money I spent on interest and I was able to do that. Perhaps the only silver lining to a very challenging time.",3
Lou Ann,"Owensboro, KY","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2020","The whole process was very detailed, accurate and professional. All personal interactions were handled very well and the end result was we closed right on schedule. The website is great also, allowing us to see all information about the loan and accelerated payment options as well.",5
Paul,"Enola, PA","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2020","They were very professional and courteous every step of the way. When our locked in rate time period ran out due to unforseen circumstances they did not charge a extension fee. The closing when quickly and smoothly. Amrock's closing employee was very professional, courteous and the closing was over quickly and smoothly. Kudos to all the personnel.",5
Matt,"Charleston, WV","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2020",My experience with RM was great until closing. My disbursement check was sent to the wrong address 3 times. After contacting RM I was told I had to contact the closing agents myself to get resolution. At no point was any help provided by RM and I had to resolve the issue with the closing agent myself. I feel there should be more responsibility and follow up with companies hired to close mortgages.,3
Jennifer,"Lake Hopatcong, NJ","Reviewed Nov. 22, 2020",We had a great experience with Jordan ** and every facet of the Rocket Mortgage process. Thanks for making it possible to save money and pay off our mortgage quicker! We loved the amount of information on the web site and also using the App!,5
Ellen,"Fort Myers, FL","Reviewed Nov. 22, 2020","After our first mortgage lender dropped the ball, didn't respond to us, asked for unnecessary documents and almost made us miss our deadlines, we approached Rocket Mortgage and were able to secure a terrific rate incredibly quickly. Jonathan kept us informed hour to hour and made the whole process smooth and quick. We have already recommended Rocket and Jonathan to friends.",5
Mark,"Harrisburg, PA","Reviewed Nov. 21, 2020",First person who contacted me was horrible (Moe). Second one who actually helped me close on my mortgage was the BEST (Kubik) and tailed everything to my needs and request. the closing process was easy and had no problems. Closing agent was also good and flexible.,5
Thomas,"Wellington, FL","Reviewed Nov. 21, 2020","Quick and easy to talk to someone live and explore options to refinance our home. Able to close quickly thereafter. From start to finish, exceptional service. Only knock would be that the closing costs seem higher now than in my past encounters with Quicken---could be related to additional government rules and regulations.",5
Tony,"Mobile, AL","Reviewed Nov. 20, 2020",Start with it taking five months to come to the closing. Then the closing agent from Amrock lost the cashier's check. My employment was verified three different times which was a bit embarrassing and in general it was just nothing like what I have come to expect with Quicken. I think this makes my fifth transaction with them and this one was a disaster. If not for John ** at QL I would have walked away. He was VERY helpful and reassuring.,2
Michael,"Glendale, AZ","Reviewed Nov. 20, 2020","It all went great, smooth and the site was easy to navigate. Everyone I interacted with was friendly and extremely helpful.

Heidi,"Crownsville, MD","Reviewed Nov. 20, 2020",Never left my house. Incredibly fast & efficient. Competitive rates. Was reached out to on occasion to keep me on track & informed - but was not pestered with continuous communications. Questions were answered immediately. Professional & courteous interactions. Best of all-No freakin robotic support menu!,5
Lisa,"Barrington, RI","Reviewed Nov. 20, 2020","From my first phone call with Maya ** to the evening of closing this has been a fabulous experience. Maya was professional, extremely knowledgeable, wonderfully able to translate financial jargon into ""English"" and to provide clear and understandable comparisons of loans and managed to do all this while being patient, kind and quite funny. She managed to make the refi of 2 mortgages work well in tandem throughout the entire process. Rates and fees were unbeatable, even by my boutique investment firm! Rocket website was so easy to navigate and use I am still rather in shock! It is useful even now that both mortgages have closed!",5
Freddie,"Baton Rouge, LA","Reviewed Nov. 20, 2020",Experience went well. The time to process the loan seemed to take longer than previous experiences with QL. As always the service was great. The time delay in processing the loan almost resulted in cancelling the refinance. This survey is not very good and I will participate in future surveys.,4
Kurt,"Bainbridge Island, WA","Reviewed Nov. 19, 2020","Our initial contact with the agent was excellent and the interface for uploading and signing documents was easy to use and very convenient. My only complaint with the process was that it took a while to get to closing. I understand that the market is especially busy right now, but after around 10 weeks had gone by and we still weren't closing we called to ask what the holdup was. By the next day we were ready to close which made it feel like it had been ready for some time and if we hadn't called it would have been idle for a some time. While I thought this could have gone better, I would still recommend Rocket Mortgage to everyone because of the convenience and lower fees.",4
Abraham,"Omaha, NE","Reviewed Nov. 18, 2020",I’m pleased about the whole transaction. Big up to the MLO agent he knows his job. After shutting down so many reps he wasn’t going down without letting me the benefits associated with the refi. Big Kudos! The one and only Rocker Mortgage!,5
Michael,"Anacortes, WA","Reviewed Nov. 16, 2020",From start to signing this is the quickest and easiest loan I have ever taken out.

Brian,"Ann Arbor, MI","Reviewed Nov. 16, 2020",The process was easy and relatively fast without any hassle. The loan officer was very polite and answered my questions in a timely manner. The return call after the loan was closed was unexpected but appreciated his call. I would recommend Rocket Mortgage to my family and friends.,4
Valerie,"Lithonia, GA","Reviewed Nov. 16, 2020","When a friend told me about their awesome experience refinancing with Rocket Mortgage, I immediately reached out online for more information. Within days a representative reached out and I was pre-approved. The process for me was surprisingly quick compared to all the refinance horror stories I've heard.",5
Kelly,"Trout Run, PA","Reviewed Nov. 16, 2020","It took from June to the end of October to get this loan closed. I was repeatedly asked for documentation of the same items over and over. I was told they weren’t submitted although I had screenshots of emails sent as attachments and uploads to the app. I was tossed from person to person as soon as I requested answers, I was given to a different person. Incredibly disappointed with the service I received.",2
Eric,"Townsend, MA","Reviewed Nov. 16, 2020","My originator was excellent! We got the appraisal back and it came back higher than expected, we asked to change it and she said there would be a minor delay. No big deal as this was my request, almost two weeks went by and we heard nothing. I reached out my originator to check on the status. That is when things went downhill. We were asked for more paystubs, were not getting notifications of needing to provide these items. Called the closing team and was told just needed to provide my wife's paystub and all would be good to close. Look the next day (again no notifications) and now they need my paystubs, after being told we were all set. The closing was smooth too.",3
Susan,"St. Louis Park, MN","Reviewed Nov. 16, 2020","Super easy and convenient. Would definitely recommend. Only took about two weeks from start to closing, which we were able to do at our dining room table. These days, almost everything can be done online. Thank you. Happy to write this review.",5

Jovey,"Severn, MD","Reviewed Nov. 14, 2020","Generally, the process went well. Although, I was hoping it would have gone faster. Especially, when it got to the very last step of verifying the buyout amount for my 2nd mortgage. The final step before closing. Additionally, maybe a little bit more communication from the lender a little after the finalizing the lender rate for the refinance. We were a bit lost after that.",4
Scott,"Mesa, AZ","Reviewed Nov. 14, 2020","I refinanced my mortgage to a lower interest rate, with QL, and the entire process was easy, convenient, and fast! I recommend Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans. If you are thinking about refinancing, look no further, you will be treated well.",5
Molly,"San Clemente, CA","Reviewed Nov. 13, 2020","I do not like to bash any organization however my experience with Rocket has been horrible. Yes, I have refinanced many times in the past but this has been the absolute worst experience. I am tracking my own file, dashboard is not updated, and there is no urgency to close my loan. And if you ask your ""Associate Banker"" for information, you will be referred to a ""customer specialist"" who will then refer you to the ""underwriting team"" who might consult with someone in the ""closing department.""More",1
James,"Las Cruces, NM","Reviewed Nov. 13, 2020","I inquired about a VA Streamline to take advantage of the current low rates and in about 30 days my loan was closed, couldn't ask for a better experience.

Ray,"Ferron, UT","Reviewed Nov. 13, 2020",I am very happy with the loan and the speed of the whole process. From start to close in less than 3 weeks. I am a little disheartened that there wasn't much person to person contact. At times I think no one wanted to actually talk to me once the application started. Still a great servicer and company.,4
Troy,"Ravenel, SC","Reviewed Nov. 13, 2020",I was approved and my QL rep didn’t tell me and didn’t do what he was supposed to do to get my loan done. I had to go from the start all over again and it took months to complete by of lost paperwork and not following up.,2
Kyler,"Clarksburg, MD","Reviewed Nov. 13, 2020","Proactive communication needs to be GREATLY improved. Any updates to our 5+ month refinance process were only received after we reached out for those updates and even then, it took multiple contact attempts. One example was a failure to verify employment. The number provided for verification was my wife's office's landline number. However, since we were all in the middle of COVID, the HR person was not in the office all week and therefore was not there when the attempt was made to verify her employment. This was not communicated to us for 4 weeks and we only learned of it after WE asked what the delay was. 4 weeks is an absolutely unacceptable amount of time to let a refinance stall over a missed phone call. An attempt to contact us for an alternate phone number should have been made immediately.",3
Fred,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed Nov. 13, 2020","Quicken thoroughly vetted me; self employed. The process was lengthy and arduous from the Borrower's side but looking at it from the Lender's side; I would have done the same things. It's money being lent to a complete stranger and a lender wants to know the loan is good. My Representatives were friendly, and quick to respond to my questions. They were well trained for the task and kept me well informed. Providing Docs was easy uploads thru the Bowwows' web-portal. I was kept up to date thru the entire process. They texted me to inform of Doc's needed if I failed to check my Account Dashboard timely. I would strongly recommend Quicken.",5
Amy,"Bethlehem, PA","Reviewed Nov. 13, 2020","I am extremely satisfied and impressed with the refi process. Customer service was always readily available.

Closing was contactless, a notary came to my home and we signed paperwork sitting masked, socially distanced, outside. We considered several companies, and I’m glad we went with Quicken. Thank you!",5
Michael,"New York, NY","Reviewed Nov. 12, 2020","Rocket Mortgage's Bankers were prompt, accurate and quick to respond throughout the entire process.

Matthew,"Apopka, FL","Reviewed Nov. 12, 2020","When I started this process in July, I was led to believe that the total closing costs would be less than $5,000. I was under the impression there were no administrative fees and was not considering the escrow funding that in total raised my loan about $10,000. I may get a little back from my previous mortgage holder from escrow, but if I were to know all of this up front, I would not have refinanced. It will take many years to recover that amount. I know I could have canceled but after waiting so long I did not want to start the process over with another company.",2
Scott,"Fall City, WA","Reviewed Nov. 12, 2020","This whole process worked well, everything happened at a good pace too. Everyone involved was helpful. The website was easy to use. It was always obvious if I needed to do anything. It was also good to see what Quicken Loans was up to in the process. The transparency was better than anything I had seen before in a mortgage transaction (and I've moved or refinanced a fair number of times!).",5
Andrew,"Apache Junction, AZ","Reviewed Nov. 11, 2020","Probably the single best refinancing experience we've ever had. We were kept constantly in the loop every step of the way, and the closing process--which usually takes 3 hours and lots of ink pens--took about 30 minutes. We were done so fast, I assumed we'd forgotten to do something. So, if you want to refinance, use Rocket and Quicken. You won't regret it.",5

While the process took a little longer than normal (I’ve refinanced twice before and secured new mortgages with you as well), this experience was during a hot mess of an epidemic which threw a wrench into everyone’s day. I applaud the team for their perseverance and recognize all the effort it took to navigate the constantly changing landscape and get us to the end goal! Thank you again and again!",4
Nicholas,"Chesapeake, VA","Reviewed Nov. 6, 2020","Overall my experience was good. The main room for improvement would have been with my banker. While trying to close on my loan I was trying to have a payment towards a stormwater fees removed because my condo association pays it. My banker did not follow through and at closing I had to work with a specialist who recommended I close my loan and request to have that payment removed afterwards, which I did. At that point it only took a couple calls/emails and a couple of documents and the fee was removed. I don't understand why this couldn't have been done during my application process. Otherwise my banker was fine. Everyone since then has been great. It was a minimal fee and not doing a. Ew escrow analysis is only a minor inconvenience since I now have only about $8 a month going to escrow for nothing but it could have been solved earlier in my opinion. Thank you to everyone who helped work this out!",4
Juan,"Houston, TX","Reviewed Nov. 6, 2020","I’m the one that needed to keep reaching out to find out information that was important. No one reached out, even when someone told me that they would put a reminder to follow up in a couple of days. No one reached out then as well.

Terrence,"Venice, FL","Reviewed Nov. 5, 2020","I closed the loan 3 weeks ago and just yesterday received a line by line, itemized and easy to visualize cost disclosure document. Maybe I should have asked for one before agreeing. Way too late now for any cost comparison. I was particularly irked that I paid a $25 out going wire transfer fee and a $12 incoming fee to the bank. I was never told about the fee beforehand. I know this was a bank charge but Quicken knew about it because the $25 charge was on the cost sheet I just received. I should have been made aware of this. I did feel a little rushed in the process.",3

Kathleen,"Pflugerville, TX","Reviewed Nov. 5, 2020","Pros: The representative I worked with was quick to respond to texts, calls, and emails. He was patient and clear with explanations. He was able to answer all my questions and did so promptly. Cons: Not the best rates out there. Instead they claim that they service the loan instead of selling it. Is this better? Probably a little, but not necessarily for the cost of a subpar loan. They were able to match a better offer from a different lender once provided with an official offer from another lender. Overall, pretty positive. They did a decent job and I'm pretty happy with the result.",5
Sherri,"Milwaukee, WI","Reviewed Nov. 5, 2020",For me it was discouraging to keep sending the same documents over and over.

I never spoke to the same person.,3

Chris ** was our mortgage banker for this refinance, as he was very professional and responsive. The only complaint we had with with Amrock and our title analyst Corey **. While waiting for our title insurance policy, he called daily - sometimes several times a day, and quoted some arcane law that didn't even apply. In addition, he failed to follow the wiring instructions for the disbursement of funds upon closing, which caused my husband to have to drive back to Wilmington while we were on vacation and go to the bank. Again, Rocket Mortgage was great, Amrock not so much.",5
