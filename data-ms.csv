Lori,"Johnstown, PA","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2023",Amazing and above and beyond experience. I couldn’t be more happy and well taken care of every step I took. I don’t know how I would have done this without the help from Rocket Mortgage and especially Sam **. Wow. He is a blessing and I don’t have enough words to say. The best there is. Was an honor to have him as a person to walk me through a world of unknowns but will say his name loud and I couldn’t be more happy. He said he would get me in a home and he did. Was like holding my hand and guiding me along every step of the way. This man is a great representation of your company and proud to say I know him. Thank you for everything.,5
James,"Longmont, CO","Reviewed Jan. 4, 2023",The process was well outlined by Darren who gave us the initial numbers to give us the cashback we wanted and get us a loan we could live with. He acted quickly. We figured we would need to provide all of our essential financial data. That was no problem. The only hitch was the time from beginning to end seemed to be a little longer than we anticipated. We started the process in mid-October and we didn't close until late December. It just seemed to be long by a few weeks.,5
Leland,"Reunion, FL","Reviewed Dec. 15, 2022","We have worked with Quicken Loans/Rocket Mortgage on many different mortgages. For the 1st time, the process was difficult and frustrating. All of the employees were very nice and helpful. The frustration seemed to come from the fact that each person was SO LIMITED in the information they could see or access. Even our main loan contact could not see our file one we were in process. That really limited him from helping us when the process got into trouble.",4
Elizabeth,"Sanford, FL","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2022","My experience was very smooth, by that I mean that Tiffany was very clear when describing my options and how each of them worked, and it showed me which one was more beneficial to my financial situation. The only thing that I found to be inaccurate was the fact that I would have two months' grace before I started my repayment process, I was looking forward to having that time to get fully ready. However, it was not a deal breaker and I was very pleased with everything else.",5
Allen,"Rolling Hills, WY","Reviewed Oct. 3, 2022",Rocket Mortgage made our buying a new home so easy & smooth I couldn’t believe it! I started out with someone else & they wanted me to several other things to get approved & it turned into a nightmare! So I tried another way & they wanted to charge me a small fortune & I found out the way they recommended me to the paperwork was fraudulent! Then I tried Rocket & I was amazed at how easy & smooth they made everything! Thank you to all those that helped us in our journey. Even with all the hiccups along the way they still made it smooth sailing & now we’re in our new home that we all adore!,5
J Bruce,"Fairhope, AL","Reviewed March 8, 2023","My refinance involved payoffs to a number of creditors, and while the refinance itself was flawless and quite streamlined, the payoffs were not. I received checks that I had to mail to the creditors--I never mail to them and didn't have addresses, etc handy. Owing to the timing, most of the payoff balances had changed. A clumsy part of an otherwise effective process.",5
Lynnette,"Port Saint Lucie, FL","Reviewed March 7, 2023","I would recommend Rocket to anyone needing a loan!!

Received checks to payoff loans in 73 hours. Would gladly work with again. First payment coming up April 1st 2023. Easy way to pay loans online. They will never sell my loan. That is why I changed to them. I kept being sold off for a total of 5 times and I had enough.,5
Aaron,"Farmington, PA","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2023",I had a good experience with all individuals that I encountered during this entire process.

Eugene,"Uniontown, OH","Reviewed Feb. 15, 2023","I could not complete my rating for my Rocket Mortgage experience because it has been over 2 weeks since closing and I still can not (as of 11:36 AM) review my loan information after signing in at your webpage.

Brian,"Aurora, IN","Reviewed Feb. 12, 2023","Been using Quicken since the early 90's. It has steadily gotten worse over the years. Seems like all they care about is raising and collecting the now, annual, subscription fee. Several times a year, I am unable to download transactions from my bank for weeks to a month at times. Quicken blames the bank, the bank blames Quicken, however, the consumer pays the ultimate price. Paying for a service that doesn't work is not good business practice. I am currently looking into alternatives to Quicken or just simply using my bank's website.",1
William,"Vernon, NJ","Reviewed Jan. 27, 2023",Rocket Mortgage made the mortgage application extremely easy from start to closing.

Donna,"Eunice, LA","Reviewed Nov. 2, 2022","Folks were nice, professional, helpful. We were able to get money to pay off bills as part of the refinance, that is why we wanted to refinance. It was a higher Interest rate than we had but we were assured we could lower it later when rates came back down. Our only problem was the ""cost"" to do this seemed high. We wanted to stay with You, so even though the cost was less elsewhere, we stayed with you.",4
George,"Elberta, AL","Reviewed Nov. 1, 2022","My experience with Rocket Loans in 2022 was a lot different than my experience in 2017 and not in a good way. Our loan was held up as the wrong type of inspection was ordered, an inspector was here for 6 hours on a Sunday, she even said she didn't know why they ordered that type of inspection, then we were lied to and told that it wasn't accepted because we didn't let them take pics of our son's bedrooms as he was sick having his wisdom teeth just removed, the person who did the 6 hour inspection told us the truth that Rocket told them they ordered the wrong type inspection and needed a traditional inspection, this had us very angry that we were lied to and it also made our loan take longer than it should have, we almost pulled out and went with another lender, but didn't want to lose even more time. Jennifer was wonderful though, was not her fault.",3
Linda,"Bellerose, NY","Reviewed Oct. 31, 2022","This was my fourth experience with a refinance and by far the easiest and quickest process to date. The person who handled my account was very knowledgeable and accessible and answered all my questions. 99% was done remotely. Their portal was very user friendly!

LiANN,"Houston, TX","Reviewed Oct. 22, 2022","Starting July 2022, Rocket Mortgage request documents in an effort to assist with a past due mortgage that remain after bankruptcy 13 voluntary dismissal. An application was required, which was received and completed. Documents requested were sent multiple times, and the reply continues to be ""we did not get them"".  Fed-Ex was sent more than twice to request the same documents over and over. Several calls were made to Rocket Mortgage with the person from the accounts resolution team confirming the documents were received, but may have been crossed in the mail and it would be noted that the information was received. However, this went on for several weeks with an account resolution team member confirming, ""Yes we received and maybe it just cross in the mail but this has been updated."" ",1
David,"Rochester, MI","Reviewed Oct. 20, 2022","It was pretty good overall. I've done several re-fi's in the past with Rocket, but this is the first time I had to provide my own Title Insurance company. Also there was some delay in the closing because my wife is unable to sign documents anymore and I became legal guardian/conservator for her. There was some mis-understandings on Rocket on how to deal with it. But overall I am happy on how it all went.",4
Cynthia,"Fayetteville, GA","Reviewed Oct. 7, 2022","As repeat clients, the service we always experience is above and beyond and we feel Rocket Mortgage has a built in WOW factor for total concern for customer resolution.

Thomas,"Ann Arbor, MI","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2022","Except for the requirement to pay for a $1100 appraisal by a person chosen by Quicken Loans, the mortgage initiation process was fine. About 8 months later, the mortgage account was flipped to Mr. Cooper and the nightmare began. Quicken stopped accepting my automatic payments BEFORE Mr. Cooper was ready to accept payments. I had no idea that my August 1 2022 payment was cancelled. I got a letter from Mr. Cooper dated August 11 2022 and I went to their website immediately and set up autopay. The website was badly designed and I had to manually enter all sorts of information that could have been transferred. I received an evening phone call confirming that everything was okay and the representative could see that I had auto pay. ",1

In important processes such as a refinance, it is comforting to know that your business relationship is valued and eagerly sought-after rather than feel you have to succumb to high-pressure tactics. I appreciate knowing I was a respected customer and was never treated as just another number/sale. Kudos to Sean **! He represented you well!",5

Donna,"Pascagoula, MS","Reviewed April 19, 2022","The loan process went well and quickly and Clarence was a great loan officer. What I didn’t like is the fact that they let everyone and his brother know that we were refinancing and how much we refinanced for. Every day, we are getting something in the mail about house warranty for the $120K refinancing of our home. Sometimes this is not even in an envelope but on a postcard for everyone to see. Other times it is in an envelope but just above the name and address it has the refinance information for all to see. I feel that this is a breach of privacy and am very disappointed in that. Other than that, everything went well.",4

Terri,"Hanover, PA","Reviewed March 18, 2022",Everything went fairly smoothly. I would give 5 stars except # 1 No one has given me information where I make my mortgage payments And # 2 One payoff check was under by $400 + and another over by $300 +. A third was used for my estimate so I owe almost $500 for that one and thought those amounts would be covered. Also the checks were delivered on my porch not in between the door as I was told. It was my understanding that my credit cards would all be of off in full. At this point I am uncertain whether or not I will receive money from the over paid loan or not which is upsetting. Also the total amounts according to Rocket and the closing agent were off by approximately $100 which was also disappointing.,3

Sami,"Coral Springs, FL","Reviewed March 15, 2022","My closing took a bit longer than most do, but the entire way through I felt taken advantage of. Constant changes to interest rates and added-on fees were snuck into the agreement without any notification. If I did not catch these myself I would be paying thousands of dollars more and I consider it to be thievery. I do not appreciate companies that do business in this way. I was also taken for close to $7,000 because of some white-labeled ""points"" that should not have been there at all. Terrible experience and would not recommend.",2

We had been in contact just 24 hours before this notice came through ending the process. We had to start over mid stream and again she was difficult and seemed to begrudge the fact she had to come out to the home.

My mother explained once when our kids were toddlers that their problems get bigger right along with them.

And as of today still don't have my disbursement due to documents not properly submitted to the County and expected to make my 1st payment in less than 2 weeks from now. By the way I already have had to make payments to accounts that were supposed to be paid off by Rocket because the grace period is already passed. Have been working with different reps and they all have apologized but the fact that me and my family still dealing with this stress due to the lack of competency of some employees makes the apologies worthless. Hope Supervisors and leadership in this company take the time to train their reps and teach them how to explain things based on State and also have the follow up once and appraisal or any other request has been submitted and don't just assume that all is good.,1

Stacey,"South Bend, IN","Reviewed Dec. 28, 2021","Hello, it was bumpy at the beginning with price gouging closing costs. Mark and Jessica came to the rescue to save the deal. The only other thing I need to complain about is the fact that you give me the checks to pay my debts and I have to mail them. 2 of the 4 are still in snail mail land 2 weeks later. I would rather see you make check payable to me. I deposit and pay my creditors online as normal. There are very few creditors can pay in person, Walmart and Sam's are not one of them! TY. Stacey",4

No choice in who I used and the man that did it gave me an appraisal $27k less than it should’ve been and I had no recourse. That was extremely stressful and dissatisfied with this situation and learning that after the fact I had no recourse and the only person that could change this was the same appraiser. Which of course they’re not going to. Not one house in my development sold for the price he gave. All were way $15k over and more. This is why I wouldn’t use Rocket again.,2

We had 4% in points, I saw online an advertisement mentioning 2 points. I re-ran the numbers and it still seemed a reasonable deal for me so I proceeded anyhow. The process was very efficient, very impressive. The fees/points did come out higher than I expected when we started. Dallas L was responsive, but I was still left wondering about those points. I was asked whether I would be checking other possibilities for refinancing, and I wonder whether I would have had a different outcome if I had said yes. I wonder why some of those fee'd items need to be done (like title search) when we have already financed with you. That was clearly done already, and we certainly did not sell and re-buy the house in the interim.",4

They will tell you not to make a payment or something until you hear from them and then they will fail to do so and report you to the credit bureau. They did this to me going into a forbearance and then tried it again coming out of forbearance and during a FRAUD REPORT TO THEM OF THEIR SYSTEM but I did not listen to them and made my payments anyway. I did this to show their lack of communication that caused the issue before that reported on my credit report and they still will not correct. Therefore I am contacting an attorney and taking my refi elsewhere. This is a sorry ** company that makes mistakes and admits them but holds you responsible on their miscommunication issues that they admit too!!!!,1

Stacey,"Blountsville, AL","Reviewed Nov. 11, 2021","Several realtors warned us, but we insisted on using this company because of how smoothly the process went when we bought the house we're in now, we should've listened. TEN DAYS before CLOSING, we get a call saying our contract has been cancelled! Why? Because they ""couldn't get an appraiser to go out and do an appraisal"". We were shocked! So through no fault of our own, and 2 grand later, cancelled. Sure, they said they could start the entire process over, AFTER THE INTEREST RATE SHOT UP, of course they will. REDICULOUS! To add to that, the person buying our house, also through Rocket, backed out of buying. Did rocket let us know? NO, if we didn't know him personally, we would still think our house is sold! They also sent an appraiser within a week of him starting HIS contract, which, is only 15 minutes from the house we were buying and said they couldn't get an appraiser. We are DONE, with this company.",1

Linda,"Morrow, GA","Reviewed Oct. 18, 2021","I was pretty satisfied with most of the procedure. The not so satisfied portion is I was told to use the AT&T website to apply and in return We are given a discount along with $2,000 towards closing cost. My closing statement did not show that and the person who explained just said you got it and did not show me the breakdown or the comparison to show my discount and closing cost credit.. I could have went to any other company to refinance but chose this one for my company perks. When talking and comparing my so call discount with friends my discount was not so discounted. For these reason, I am very disappointed.",3

Kenneth,"Steilacoom, WA","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2021","We had our original loan with Quicken and wanted to do a re-finance to get a better rate. They had all the information from our original loan from about five years earlier. We had made all our payments on time and included extra funds to pay off the principal faster. Our credit ratings were excellent...mine 850 and my wife's 800+. Instead of asking for all the needed information up front, we were pestered for more information as soon as they received what they asked for. This process took over three months. Instead of being able to contact one person at Quicken, we dealt with several people over the course of the application. ",1

Frederica,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed Oct. 7, 2021","I did not have a good experience with Quicken Loans. I was referred to the company and applied online after reading a lot of the rave reviews. To say I ended up disappointed would be an understatement. I dealt with two different loan officers, or bankers. Both men were obnoxious and downright patronizing with one of them (Brandon) behaving like he was trying to sell me a new car instead of helping me get a better rate that would help me keep my home.

Brenda,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed Sept. 30, 2021","I had 2 problems with my experience with my refi. 1) The appraisal company used only tried to lower my house value to fit the comps that he was able to find in the area. My house is unique and he did not use the unique pictures to compare value. He purposely left them out of the appraisal. 2) I started my loan process on a Thursday. On Saturday I tried to contact my loan officer to tell him of the American Express offer that I wanted to apply for. I was informed that it was too late and I could not use it because it would delay the process. I had just received the email about the offer and I had just started the process so how was it too late to get in on the $2,000 credit on my current bill.

C Leonard,"Naperville, IL","Reviewed Sept. 27, 2021","Overall I had a positive experience with my primary account manager. If there was an opportunity for improvement it would be fewer attempts to contact me and better communication of a zero cost transaction. Ritchie was excellent but couldn’t validate closing costs. Jeff K was extremely helpful in bringing the loan to closure but minimized my confusion around my monthly mortgage, only focusing on the escrow increase versus the escrow and loan increase. Unfortunately I called him as he was heading to vacation, which he reinforced and informed me that if I was interested in continuing I should move on. I’m certain this refinancing was not a significant revenue maker but I was taken aback by his dismissive tone. I acknowledge that I missed the details that were clearly spelled out upon closer review, yet I assume respect to be the norm of Rocket even when information has been shared.",4

He helped me so much and took time to explain things when I had questions. It was quick and smooth.

Nancy,"Appleton, WI","Reviewed Sept. 1, 2021","Everything went very well with my mortgage from start to finish. The only thing that was bothersome was when I got a message from an appraiser, and I didn't know anything about it. No one from Rocket Mortgage notified me that I would be getting a call from them. In this day and age, a person can't be too careful with responding to unknown callers. I called Rocket Mortgage and was told they had no idea who the appraiser was going to be. I messaged the person I was working with from Rocket mortgage- and he told me he was sure it was valid??? The communication in regards to the appraiser was bad.",4
Micharl,"New Castle, IN","Reviewed Sept. 1, 2021","Quick, easy and painless. Great people to work with. Helped me lower my interest rate and will enable me to pay off home quicker.

Jean,"Farmington, ME","Reviewed Sept. 1, 2021","The process went smoothly with courteous assistance when needed. Closing was easy and convenient. Having been through the process before I understood that ""out of pocket"" expense did not really equate to ""cost of refinancing"", but for others it might be. That's the ONLY complaint I have. The experience with Rocket was pleasant and efficient. I have no qualms about recommending you to others.",5
Nora,"Redlands, CA","Reviewed Sept. 1, 2021",Experience was great! So fast with everything. Easy access online. Great customer service. Would highly recommend!

Debra,"Collinsville, CT","Reviewed Aug. 30, 2021","We were very impressed with Rocket Mortgage in the beginning stages of our refinance however, several items were requested from up duplicate to triplicate times and employment verification was holding up process numerous times when we had both been with our current employer 25 years. It became insulting. All in all, aside from very exorbitant closing costs, we are satisfied.",3
Jason,"Thompsons Station, TN","Reviewed Aug. 30, 2021","I am genuinely surprised at how fast the turnaround time from discussing our loan options to having a new, signed loan that met all my expectations and was almost exactly what I wanted! It was honestly a quick and easy process. The only hiccup through the entire thing was the 'in-home' signing agent (NOT an employee of Quicken loans!) was strangely political and too quick to offer her opinions --that we never asked for. Not Quicken Loan's fault by any means, but hopefully they can do a better job screening their outside agents a little better in the future. Overall it has been a great experience that really has helped me get my finances straight!",5
Sharae,"Merkel, TX","Reviewed Aug. 30, 2021","Rocket Mortgage was absolutely great! From the application process to the closing. The time it took to get the loan closed was very short! One thing we did not like was not having someone there to answer questions during the closing process at the Title company. We did have a few questions just because this paperwork is foreign to us. The woman at the Title company treated us as if we had used an ""off-brand"" mortgage company. She didn't necessarily say anything bad about Rocket Mortgage. She just acted like there were things that needed to be pointed out in the contract. This is not anything Rocket Mortgage could control as this is a different entity. But we will know in the future to not use that Title company again. As far as Rocket Mortgage we couldn't be happier! In fact, our previous mortgage company was not interested in doing the cash-out refinance. So we give Rocket Mortgage 5 stars! Thank y'all for helping us become debt-free!",5
Stephen,"Pueblo, CO","Reviewed Aug. 30, 2021","Outstanding service and the people were easy to work with, and when I had questions they were more than willing to work with me and help me with any computer issues.

He never kept me informed. He was short with me on the phone and told me and my realtor one thing (that he apparently did not put in his notes) and then said another to the closing team. He gave me one date to close and the closing team another date. Then he was out of the office and did not leave me anyone to contact (Logan always did).

Kathleen,"New Ulm, MN","Reviewed Aug. 24, 2021","Dana ** was incredible. She took care of all the details. She let me know just which supporting papers were needed and when. My appraisal went well. The appraiser called the day before he was going to come so that I could have the house looking clean and uncluttered. My house was appraised at $15,000 more than I expected. The notary public also alerted me to what time he would be coming, and he was quick and professional. The only thing that has not gone well is the pay-off on my car loan. Huntington Bank asked for more money than I was prepared for, and they still have not finalized the loan by sending me the paid-in-full status.",5

Jimmy,"Killeen, TX","Reviewed Aug. 16, 2021","Our second experience with Quicken/Rocket was a little less smooth than the first, but the end result met the need. One problem was the length of time caused by an issue out of your control - finding an appraiser.

Unfortunately, that draft has yet to be returned.",4

I was put in touch in an expert to who I explained what I wanted and within 24 hours I received another call to confirm/explain my next steps. Within a week I was set up for closing. The whole process was seamless. Each and every member of the tech was helpful and informed. I felt comfortable throughout. I’ve considered refinancing but was not sure of the whole process. Quicken Loans made the whole process as easy as 123.",5
Vickie,"Grand Terrace, CA","Reviewed July 22, 2021","The entire process was handled expediently and professionally. I have no complaints whatsoever. This was done so fast and I was kept in the loop the entire time. All my questions were answered immediately. Loved the ""Dashboard"" feature.

Robert,"Copperas Cove, TX","Reviewed July 22, 2021","Ok, was contacted by Quicken Loans, and others as we searched for a refi w/ monies out loan. We didn't need nor want to borrow, a large jumbo amount. In fact the refi and monies out were to be 75k. Our credit is near perfect, Others upfront just told us, ""We won't do the loan because it's not enough."" They wanted to raise the loan amount to a minimum of 100k. But quicken said, ""Yea, no problem. We can help with that request."" So, we were happy that someone could and would loan the lesser amount we wanted.",1
Robert,"Cornelius, OR","Reviewed July 22, 2021","This was a great experience and everyone was always available, even on the weekends. Kory was very knowledgeable and resourceful.

Lauri,"West Bloomfield, MI","Reviewed July 22, 2021",Greg and every one I interacted with along the way were great. I had a super fast approval and closing. I was able to follow the process of the loan every step of the way. I highly recommend Quicken loans for your refinance or home purchase.,5
Barbara,"Spokane Valley, WA","Reviewed July 21, 2021","When talking with different agents they were pleasant, helpful and gave correct information as well as walking me through the steps of completing my refinance.

Sandra,"Kissimmee, SC","Reviewed July 20, 2021","I had a great experience getting my loan. However I got a notice in mail stating it was urgent. I call Quicken after my Loan closed. So I called Q Rep said Quicken had some information they needed to deliver in person, dropping off and could I be there one night. I said ok. Rep said a woman named Sllvey would be in the area and would drop off onto at 6 pm. I said, ""Ok. I could be there."" I’m driving home and at 5:45 my phone rings. Silvey is outside my house waiting.

Will definitely recommend.",5
Carol,"San Francisco, CA","Reviewed July 20, 2021","Although the refinancing took a long time, QL kept my interest rate low and my loan details did not change. It does cost quite a bit including points, and there are other mortgage companies charging lower interest rates, but QL really excels in customer connection. I always had someone to call and had a good understanding of what was going on. It was an excellent experience overall.",5
Darjan,"Elko, NV","Reviewed July 20, 2021","Stellar experience. Process was quick, seamless and transparent. Highly recommend Rocket Mortgage (Quicken Loans). We got the best interest rate and it is refreshing to see the principal on the loan actually making a difference in our balance. Unlike our previous lender where the principal only dropped 16k in 7 years. Love the online process, steady updates and availability of the process team. Thank you.",5
Barry,"Salem, OR","Reviewed July 20, 2021","Lost my first application, told me I would not have to pay any escrow fees. Told me I would get my money back and have not received any. Passed me around from person to person. The team had very little communication on handling my refinance. This was totally different from my first loan finance.",2
Larry,"Mesa, AZ","Reviewed July 20, 2021",We started. Around March. 1st and closed and signed about July 16th. Seemed like every time we were done..something else would pop up..mostly verified my employment...I've been at the same job 36. Years. The company is the largest rental company in the US...should be an easy job...I almost canceled the whole the whole loan... But the second attempt went faster.. Just took too long.,3
Edward,"Billerica, MA","Reviewed July 17, 2021",Glad I was able to refi but was not happy with some of the staff. I had to send same documents multiple times. My boss had to be bothered to verify my employment multiple times with same information and I thought it was overkill.,2
Janice,"Holly Springs, MS","Reviewed July 17, 2021",The experience was painless in that it was a very speedy process. Each step was clear and provided me the opportunity to ask questions. Each representative I spoke with was  knowledgeable of that particular process. I would recommend to a friend!,5
Francis,"Peoria, AZ","Reviewed July 17, 2021",The whole process went very well. I had some timing issues because of prior commitments and the Quicken team worked with me to accommodate my needs. The closing also went very well. The Quicken teem was also able to accommodate my schedule to get the closing done.,5
Timothy,"Corinth, TX","Reviewed July 16, 2021","I worked with Josh ** and the rest of the team to get my refinance done. I was shocked at how simple it was to apply, upload our documents, receive documents back, sign them, and close out the process. Everything except for the final closing meeting was done from the comfort of my own home. The team was very responsive and friendly as well.",5
Robert,"Tx, MI","Reviewed July 16, 2021",Excellent. Did not disappoint; Ryan ** was attentive and provided information as requested.

I would highly recommend RocketMortgage!",5
Mark,"Palm Coast, FL","Reviewed July 15, 2021","Overall experience was great. The only thing that surprised me was that Quicken overpaid the payoff by a couple of thousand. Wells Fargo and Chase credited that to me, but it means I accidentally borrowed a couple of more thousand than I needed.",5
George,"Breesport, NY","Reviewed July 14, 2021","Ashli ** was great to work with. My only semi negative observation was the first closing date (July 6) was established by someone mistakenly reading a 45-day post-possession clause and taking 45 days to the date of the purchase contract. When I kept questioning how Quicken established the closing date, I was told, ""It's in the sales contract (dummy)."" We could have closed sooner if someone had taken the time to carefully read the purchase offer. By the time I figured out what was happening, we were only able to move the closing up by a week or so.",5
Barry,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed July 14, 2021","Responding to the requests for supporting documents seemed neverending. A list of what was needed should have been known upfront, but I was constantly receiving a request for additional documents. For example, I was asked to provide insurance coverage for a small lake home worth about 250k. Why I would need to document that is unknown to me as it has no bearing on my ability to refinance a note. This is all the more surprising because I'd been paying off a much higher loan for about 18 years and even prepaying much of it so my ability to pay should have been evident. ",4
Tanya,"Houston, TX","Reviewed July 14, 2021",The response time was quick. They were very thorough. Ensuring they explained the process in great detail. Additionally they took the time to answer my many questions. They also did very great follow up.,5
Michael,"Alto, MI","Reviewed July 13, 2021","Didn’t like how you passed along from team member to team member. Information seems to get mixed up or not sent through the system, it was very frustrating at times, being told by one person something and another person saying something else, we were held up in our closing because of an insurance issue on another property that wasn’t worth much, just too much confusion. Also your online info was not updated as fast as it should have.",3
Lakesha,"Woodbridge, VA","Reviewed July 13, 2021","The refinance process went very quickly, especially since my loan specialist requested most of my documentation in the first phone call. He was experienced, knowledgeable and friendly, but also knew how to navigate the process. I had no delays and my funds were deposited into my account earlier than anticipated. 100x easier than my initial home buying process. Thank you!",5
Chris,"Canyon Lake, CA","Reviewed July 13, 2021",Katlyn ** was my rep and she was amazing. The process was painless and super easy. She kept me advised through the whole thing and my re-fi closed in 2 weeks. I was very impressed with her professionalism and service.,5

I was immediately approved to match what my employer only would approve me for. Then he asked a profound question, ""is that all you want""?

They were easy to work with, understanding and flexible. Closing was estimated to take about 30 days compared to 60-75 days from other lenders. I was under duress for a balloon payment due soon and must admit it felt like flying through a deadly storm in an aircraft (The unknown). And before I knew it it was done and I was through it.

Wanda,"Dallas, TX","Reviewed June 26, 2021","I am a customer of Quicken Loans, so when I decided to remodel, I wanted to see my options. I didn't get the loan structure I wanted which was some debt payoff plus equity and no one communicated to me that ALL of my debt would be included in the loan, including my vehicle, which is ridiculous to me. Who refinances their vehicle in a 30 year loan? I just think that if a customer asks for one loan structure and you can't give it to them, let them know. A simple phone call can remove the limbo effect. You are Quicken Loans, so it doesn't take that long to get an answer on ""yeah"" or ""nah"".",1

The only issue was that the second loan estimate of closing costs was oddly farther off as compared to the initial estimate. I was a bit concerned as I knew some of the numbers were off, but it was all corrected at the time of closing. The Quicken Loans representative assigned to me to help with the closing did well, but oddly, she could not help me with loan estimate. This document was apparently generated from the another section (the person I originally worked with to set the loan rate. Ideally, the QL rep should be the sole point of contact and not be put into the position of telling the client that ""you have to talk to someone else at Quicken, not my section.""

Deb,"Sapphire, NC","Reviewed June 9, 2021","Friendly, accurate, helpful. The process was driven by the excellent work of the employees. Did not feel like we were pulling teeth. They did what they said they would do, in a very timely fashion. We were actually in the “process” of refi with another company for over 6 months. We called Quicken and we're closed in less than 39 days.",5
Kevin,"Cheney, WA","Reviewed June 8, 2021","We were referred to Quicken Loans by Charles Schwab for a refinance of our primary residence. The Quicken people were very difficult to work with from the very beginning. The main issue was over the appraisal of our home. Just 3 months prior to the refinance, we had our home appraised and the cost of the appraisal was $650. Quicken wanted to charge us $1800 to get our home appraised. We asked them to use the original appraisal from a certified appraiser but they would not, citing company policy that they had to hire their own appraiser. Remember that you do not have a choice in who they contract with for any of their outsourced services and they expect you to pay for them. (Subsequently, both appraisals came in within a couple hundred dollars of each other.) ",1
Donald,"Petersburg, VA","Reviewed June 8, 2021","My experience was an unbelievable great and hassle free journey with little or no effort involved.

Jeffrey,"Saint Joseph, MI","Reviewed June 7, 2021","I had many choices of mortgage lenders and Kevin ** is the only reason I choice Quicken. Chase actually may have been a lower total cost, but I knew I would not be getting the same experience without Kevin **. Also, there was an issue with calculating total escrow due at closing and it was not handled very smoothly. That issue was between Chicago Title Agency and someone other than Kevin ** (I forget the name of the lady I spoke to). Good thing Kevin ** was there to talk me off the ledge though...",5

Gary,"New Milton, WV","Reviewed June 3, 2021","While reviewing my credit file, I noticed an inquiry from Quicken loans. I contacted them to see what that was all about and was told I had inquired about a mortgage. Knowing that was not true, I explained that my home was paid for and I have no reason to refinance. They refused to remove the inquiry from my credit. After further investigation, I discovered, it is common practice for quicken loan officers to research your information and submit it as if you were inquiring about a loan. They do this to inflate their productivity numbers. Especially around each quarter or coming up to employment evaluation. ",1
Brett,"Huntington, IN","Reviewed June 3, 2021","Professional, Quick, easy to complete and every step was organized. The best customer service I have ever used. Timely in every step as well as easy to learn which steps to take for help. Thank you for doing our refi.",5

Harry,"Hollywood, FL","Reviewed May 31, 2021","Although I qualified for a loan in less than two days, paid my $500.00 deposit for the appraisal and credit check, they were never able to get my loan processed. They claim that they could not get an appraiser for the property. I realize real-estate is in high demand right now. Their resources of appraisers is very limited and ended up in cancelling my loan. They did refund most of the deposit but not within the time frame they said it would happen, seven days. It took ten days, a phone call and an email and was completed within two days after the second contact, they kept $85.00 for a credit check.

The interest changed and I didn't know what it was afterwards. I didn't know what it was and never found out. I did not realize that no one lived in Vegas so that I could ask questions. Moreover there were too many names of your different businesses and I never knew who or what I was dealing. So afterwards, I was rather frustrated.",2
Michael,"Loganville, GA","Reviewed May 27, 2021","Excellent all the way to the end. The closing agent was a little unpleasant to work with, but all and all a good experience. It was very quick. The best was Taylor who got the ball rolling. He is very good!",5
Sharron,"Katy, TX","Reviewed May 27, 2021",The payoff was sent to wrong mortgage company. I called loan contact to let them know the loan had been sold.

Joseph,"Gorham, NH","Reviewed May 26, 2021",The appraisal company that you deal with is NOT very customer friendly. On numerous occasions I attempted to contact them to get either no response or 3-5 days later. My 1st appraisal took over 3 months to get completed.

Patina,"Metropolis, IL","Reviewed May 23, 2021","My husband basically clicked on clickbait and was contacted almost immediately by someone. She gave him pretty high hopes, only to basically go MIA when our appraisal came back low (as I’d expected). We did have contact with others that helped with our questions and, overall, I’d still call it a good experience because we were able to pay off some debt and save money with a lower interest rate, even if we only came back with a little cash out instead of the several thousand we’d started out with hopes of.",3

They call 5-10 times per day while I’m at work. Each day I called them once I was home and had the time to dedicate to speaking with them. Once I get through the process of answering the general questions (which I answered online for them to contact me with so one would think they would look up my name?) they tell me they are going to transfer me to the loan expert but then they are all busy. I’ve gotten a few different reasons or excuses I’m not sure which it is but I understand it’s a busy time for buying houses and I’m not in a huge rush but I am on a timeline with a lease up in a few months.,2

Mike sent me all available offers via e-mail and advised me to take my time reviewing them and then get back to him. I did just that. I was overwhelmed after making a selection, but I still wasn't sure. This is the first time I was doing a mortgage of any kind by myself. We spoke again, and even though I was shaking all over, I agreed to the new mortgage and cash out! I breathed a sign of relief and the rest was so easy. All the paperwork was simple via e-mail, I had a lawyer in town that I trusted. At this point in my life, this was the best move for me, and relieved me of all the credit card debt.

When I had questions, he would reply promptly and ensure a resolution. He is AWESOME! Only suggestion I have is to ask your representatives to be aware of your client's possible autopay arrangement. I wish I was advised to take our former account off autopay, because the autopay mortgage was taken out of our checking account a day after closing (I had assumed this would not happen as the ""system"" would have to know of our closing and the new loan being due June 1).

Jon never called me back to let me know interest rates were rising. Finally I called him and then he quoted me a rate of 3.375% with one point.

I closed my loan on 3/31 and the first payment on my new loan is 5/1, however they still took my $1550 payment out on 4/1 as well. The autopay was on. No one told me I needed to go turn that off. According to what I have been told that my old loan was paid off on 4/7 and while tomorrow will be the 8th business day, I have been without the 1550 for 18 days as I live on calendar not business days. One lady I called into said she switched me to get my money refunded to me by electronic deposit instead of mail but another lady said it took 10 business days. It sure is funny how you can never miss getting your money very quickly every month on the dot but the one time you owe me money, it takes this long. ",4

Michele,"Waukesha, WI","Reviewed April 17, 2021","I haven’t used this Company. But, many of my friends have. I have spoken to them several times about a refinance. I think they are awesome. Everyone is clear and concise. They don’t sell your loan. Mine has been sold six times already. Plus, they are very fair with their credit qualifications. One of the rare companies that realize, bad things happen to good people. I would encourage everyone I know to use them. Plus they have great rates. They are go-getters. They get the job done!!. In my opinion they tell you the facts, not what you want to hear. Go with Quicken loans. I so regret not using them.!! I wish I would have. Next mortgage, they have earned my business. Big stellar Company, with plenty of buying power.",5
John,"Fredericksburg, VA","Reviewed April 16, 2021",Most of the experience was great. Easy to submit documents and to get in touch with my rep. There were some negatives though. The interest rep was very pushy. Some of the paperwork had to be submitted several time. They messed up my taxes on the escrow and that still needs to be resolved.,4
Melinda,"Morgan Hill, CA","Reviewed April 16, 2021","Third time using Quicken. No problems, questions addressed quickly and thoroughly. Did not give us all the information needed for paying off and closing the line of credit with our credit union. Recommended quick into our daughter-in-law who had a terrible experience and will never use Quicken Loans Again.",4
Karen,"Portland, OR","Reviewed April 16, 2021","I have never met a company with such polite employees. I have never heard please and thank you so often, usually in every sentence. In particular Anthony ** is exceptional for friendliness and patience. I am ""older"" and not adept with computers and my equipment is basic and does not scan, fax or print legal sized papers. Anthony always found a way for me to complete my tasks. Everyone else was polite and helpful also. I will definitely recommend your company to friends and family. Thank you.",5
Glenda,"North Port, FL","Reviewed April 16, 2021",The staff at Quicken Loans are phenomenal and pleasant to work with. They stay on top of the mortgage process to quickly bring you to closing. Quicken streamlines the process from the very first call and they will stay on the phone with you and walk you through filling out the loan application online. They also give huge discounts for loyal customers and another big plus is that they never sell your loan so you don’t have to worry about your payoff getting messed up! I have the Rocket Mortgage app on my phone (that is their app for your mortgage) so that I can quickly see my progress and get any statements or tax information I need. We are building a house now and their closing costs quote for the construction to permanent loan is over $3000 less than other lenders so of course we are sticking with them!,5
Selly,"Reno, NV","Reviewed April 15, 2021","Professional, knowledgeable, helpful with the quick response. We received the lowest interest for the house refinance. We are glad that we switched from Penny Mac to you guys since 3 yrs ago. We received nothing but the best!!! ????",5
Andrea,"Reno, NV","Reviewed April 15, 2021","Quicken Loans aka: Rocket Mortgage. Recent cash-out refi completed. If I were to just rate QL & their employees, I would give them 5 stars for professionalism & caring. But...they partner with Amrock at closing. Amrock employees are robotic, ignorant of customers' specific loans & really don't give a damn to get the answers you need. All went well until closing. While you are notified what's next & what dates & figures are when closing, with Amrock small changes started to appear I never agreed to & weren't informed of. ",2
Hugh,"Quitman, GA","Reviewed April 15, 2021",Overall I was pleased. However the procedure was long and quite stressful. But the ending was successful and I'm pleased about that. My wife and I worked together on this project and she feels the same as I do. We worked with several different Quicken Loan people and all were pleasant and helpful.,4
Diane,"Conroe, TX","Reviewed April 15, 2021","I filled in an online quick app. Then I started to get a large amount of calls from them. I also received an email telling me that neither they, nor Rocket Morgage could help me at this time, because I wanted to do a cash out refinance. I have a $72k in equity in my home. I wanted to take out enough to upgrade my window and doors. They turned me down online, but continue to call too many times each day! Looking into other mortgage companies.",2
Sheril,"Riverton, UT","Reviewed April 14, 2021","Our home refinance was seamless, items were completed in the amount of time stated or sooner. We actually closed a couple of weeks earlier than originally told, we could not have had a better experience. Thank you to the Rocket Mortgage Team.",5
Lamanda,"Garland, NC","Reviewed April 14, 2021",Thank you Quicken Loans!!! I would recommend this company to anyone. They was very helpful and the loan process was easy. The customer service was good and I always received a call back if I needed to ask any questions.,5
Ronda,"Hayward, CA","Reviewed April 14, 2021",Jacob ** was so great. I received a great percentage rate and he helped me in many ways. He's very professional and was there for me every bit of the way. Jacob and others responded to my questions right away. My loan was not easy. I had been on Covid lay off but I had been at my job for 23 years which I started again in October. I'm so happy I went with Quicken Loans and have already told 3 others who are looking for loans. You're very lucky to have Jacob ** working for Quicken loans. Thanks again.,5
Candace,"Loganville, GA","Reviewed April 14, 2021",The application process was super easy and my refinance closed within a week. Nathan ** was very nice and helpful through the process. My only complaint - after my refi closed you apparently sold my information to every mortgage insurance company in the US because I have been deluged with spam mailings trying to sell me said mortgage insurance.,4
Stephanie,"Edmonds, WA","Reviewed April 14, 2021","I requested a refinance with Rocket Mortgage, and the entire process was a positive one. I like that you can view the process online and how easy it was to submit and upload documents. Anytime I had a question, my contact was quick to respond. We were able to close on our refinance in less than 30 days.",5
Steve,"Harrisburg, NC","Reviewed April 14, 2021","Everything went off as planned, preclosing was perfect, lady came on appointed day, checks were sent to us very quickly.

All finished within 30 days.",5
Jane,"Decatur, GA","Reviewed April 10, 2021","My experience was seamless from beginning to end. Even though I could have gotten a lower rate, I felt that Quicken would be much easier to deal with. The only trouble I had, which was with the closing, was easily corrected to my satisfaction. Excellent and professional experience.",5
Kayla,"Denton, TX","Reviewed April 9, 2021","Once you go through the 1st part of qualifying for the loan and you start having to send in paperwork and appraisals the communication lacks. We are always having to email or call for updates. Our closing date was less than a week away and then they wanted us to do a stop payment on our current mortgage provider, then our closing was pushed back a month so we still ended up having to pay our current mortgage company later that month. Also we did not get any notices that our previous mortgage was paid off.",4
William,"Smyrna, GA","Reviewed April 8, 2021",Very efficient. Those I dealt with were knowledgeable and personable. Easy process. Second loan we have done with Quicken. Both were extremely easy. I have said all I can think to say about the process - very pleased.,5
Ana,"Winter Haven, FL","Reviewed April 7, 2021","The refinance process was amazing. Esteban and Jason were great! This was a very great experience, it was better than when we originally purchased our current home. The overall process was very smooth and we had a quick closing within a few days from starting our refinance application. We will definitely recommend family and friends to Quicken Loans!",5
Ronald,"Winchester, VA","Reviewed April 7, 2021",The people that work with me was very very professional. I started out with Chase then I had Malik ** and then I had a few girls I talk to and all of them is right on the ball what timely manner and that means a lot because you always want to know where it's going and the information on it. I'm very proud to have you all work with me and I'll recommend you all to everybody. I know and I'll show you use you again and again. Thanks a lot Quicken Loans. I really really appreciate it.,5
Adrian,"Laplata, MD","Reviewed April 6, 2021","The entire process, from start to finish was done professionally and easy. The people I dealt with were very kind and explained the process thoroughly. If there was something I did not understand, they were very patient and made sure I knew exactly what they were talking about. I would not hesitate to recommend anyone I know who has an interest in refinancing to Quicken Loans.",5
Dennis,"Novi, MI","Reviewed April 6, 2021",Easy from beginning to end. Great agent Aaron **. Answered all of questions and concerns promptly. Every part went smoothly. Even after closing Aaron answered my questions about when and how to make our payments. And I was also sent instructions on that via e-mail.,5
Maria,"Bridgeport, WV","Reviewed April 5, 2021","I was very pleased with the entire loan process with Quicken. Every person I spoke to was very helpful, friendly and well informed.

Nicholas,"Kissimmee, FL","Reviewed April 5, 2021","I used Quicken loans to refinance my mortgage and I have no complaints at all. Everything was easily done online, I was able to get much better rates and the cash to close was even lower than what I was told at the beginning of the process. So far so good!",5
Jessica,"Houston, TX","Reviewed April 5, 2021","I was very disappointed in the level of communication. I REPEATEDLY asked not to be called, only to be emailed. I asked on the phone and in writing. And I was still called OFTEN. Whoever was handling my actual mortgage and values NEVER walked me through anything. I was given their name at some point at my closing, and had never heard of them. The company you use for closings makes it very inconvenient to schedule something that works for me. And the website is very awkward to use.",2
Jason,"Myrtle Beach, SC","Reviewed April 5, 2021",Everyone we worked with was quick to respond and we felt like they were working on our behalf. When rates dropped Quicken contacted us to offer a refinance at a lower rate. We were very happy with our experience and would use Quicken again.,5
Walter,"Stafford Township, NJ","Reviewed April 3, 2021",Everything from start to finish was done very professionally. All questions and concerns were answered and or explained to our satisfaction.

Jerry,"Yucca Valley, CA","Reviewed April 2, 2021",Howie ** was fantastic. Helped us with our loan. Made it so easy and simple to understand everything.

Tyler,"Mooresville, NC","Reviewed April 2, 2021",Jeremy ** took care of everything for me. I barely had to do anything really. Come prepared with your docs and it’s a breeze. They sent a notary right to my house to finish physical docs after I already reviewed them online. Very very easy process from start to finish.,5
M Theresa,"Knoxville, TN","Reviewed March 31, 2021","All the representatives were helpful and knowledgeable in helping me through the refinance process.

Brandi,"Huntingtown, MD","Reviewed March 31, 2021",The process was easy and quick. I would recommend anyone to use Quicken Loans.

Lillian,"Fennville, MI","Reviewed March 30, 2021",I was hesitant to go through an all online mortgage company but the team I worked with was fantastic. Sarah ** was fabulous. She explained everything to me and walked me step by step of what needed to get done. I didn't ever feel like I was completely lost or alone. Sarah and her team were there for me from the start till the end and continue to help me with questions that come up. I have already recommended Quicken Loans to my friends and family.,5
Julie,"Ave Maria, FL","Reviewed March 30, 2021",As always Quicken Loans has been top notch. I constantly recommend Quicken to friends and family. From the first call to the website to access your account. Nothing short of outstanding service and exceptional treatment. Everything is thoroughly explained and you are treated as a valued customer. There are many ways to contact Quicken and response is always timely.,5
Tara,"Wake Forest, NC","Reviewed March 29, 2021",I was blown away by the speed of completion of our recent refinance. Our mortgage broker Bryan was incredibly accessible and professional and forthcoming every step of the way. I never had to wait for any info more than a few hours. I would highly recommend Quicken loans to anyone in need of the service!,5
Sandra,"Northlake, IL","Reviewed March 29, 2021",I really only received the initial call once all my documents were submitted. Everything was handled online. I little more direction would have been helpful especially closer to the end of the process right before the closing was scheduled. I think a call after everything is finalized to explain the closing documents and review the loan that will be paid off against the new loan for better understanding.,4
Mark,"Girard, OH","Reviewed March 29, 2021",The overall experience was simple and easy. From uploading our documents to keeping track of where we were in the process. Our representative did a great job finding the right loan for us. Would recommend this service to friends.,5
Richard,"Bluffton, SC","Reviewed March 29, 2021",Our mortgage consultant was knowledgeable and very professional. The process was thorough and extremely user-friendly. One outstanding item on your end was to have your department (fresh start?) contact me concerning a collection item appearing on my credit report. Please contact me as soon as possible so we can close this issue.,5
Jason,"Cedar Park, TX","Reviewed March 27, 2021","Donya was a pleasure to work with. She was friendly from the get go. She was very accommodating when working through the different financing options. Donya made it possible for us to get debt free, without setting us back years in paying for our home. She was very communicative and ensured we were able to close as quick as possible.",5
Hubert,"Greensburg, IN","Reviewed March 26, 2021",This experience was less than satisfactory. It took 6 months to complete. I was told at closing I would need a witness which was untrue. It took 3 attempts and $50 extra for me to get my closing fee processed because your system canceled my online attempt and would not accept my personal check after it made it way back to the closing office. I had to go to the bank and have the money wired finally and cancel my personal check for safety reasons. Just not a great experience. I won't do it again.,2
Pamela,"Bloomington, IN","Reviewed March 26, 2021","Looking over my closing docs it appeared that we (new customers) were set up for e-payment which we did not want. The customer service rep was able to immediately confirm that we were not on e-pay. He was cordial, professional and provided a quick answer.",5
Kimberly,"Fremont, NH","Reviewed March 26, 2021",Your website is amazing and provides all the information necessary to see where you are at in your loan process. Every person I spoke with was knowledgeable and professional and helped to move the closing along. I believe it was a 4 week process total and we closed at the rate promised. Lara was my loan originator and she stayed in touch with us all through the process. You are doing everything right to help make the process smooth and efficient. Thank you.,5
Sandra,"Maud, TX","Reviewed March 26, 2021","The staff was good and knowledgeable. Had some hiccups but that is expected with any company. Would use them again. I would also recommend them. Took a little longer than I wanted but the staff worked hard to make it happen for us, AND THEY DID.",4
Dianne,"Ormond Beach, FL","Reviewed March 25, 2021",I had Lo **. She was very professional. I had been turned down before by Quicken Loans because I did not have an award letter from my husband's corporation stating I was the beneficiary of his pension. He died in 1998 and I did not have this letter but I had all of the documentation that my husband signed. So underwriting said they could to proceed without it. I thought it was unfair since I had been receiving the pension since 1990 and had years of documentation and Social Security.,5
Michael,"Sequim, WA","Reviewed March 25, 2021",I contact Quicken to let them know that I had not received a hard copy of my documents as well as I would be paying via mail and asked for a payment book or monthly statement and I have not received either and payment is due April 2nd.

The final signing took 15 minutes at my home. Thank you so much.",5
Victoria,"Bloomington, IL","Reviewed March 23, 2021","While the necessity for taking out a mortgage was a very hard decision to make, the process was less difficult due to the competence, kindness, and attentiveness of my agent, Jason **.

George,"Moorpark, CA","Reviewed March 23, 2021",Very smooth and rapid refinance process. Outstanding rates and very knowledgeable people to help with any questions.

Chris,"Chandler, AZ","Reviewed March 20, 2021","The 1st call- ""I'm so-and-so and I'm here to see you through the process, of course we can do everything you ask. We'll need a deposit for the appraisal."" 3 weeks later and about a dozen document requests (each of which are a few days apart instead of asking for everything all at once and each time the ""We have everything we need"" message pops up) later, not a single word from our ""Dedicated Representative."" I reach out. ""I'm sorry but now that your loan is in process you can call our 800 and reach our customer advocacy group."" AWESOME, now we get a call center and the bounce around. Another 2 weeks of individual document submissions. Call back and start to threaten calling various government agencies, consumer affairs, etc. Guy says ""Well we have to get this closed soon because your rate lock expires in 10 days.""",1

Thomas,"Canton, GA","Reviewed March 19, 2021","Overall it was painless, accurate. Took a little longer than expected but end results was very happy and easy. The Rocket Mortgage app simplified the process of getting important info to the appropriate people as the loan progressed.

NOT happy with that!!!",5

Not good communication, excuses given with not much detail. Took us three times to finally close. Not impressed with this company.",3

First the closing was scheduled for a Sunday but the person did not show. We rescheduled but the people at Rocket Mortgage did not know that we had to reschedule. Then I was told that I did not have to pay the Feb. mortgage but then I was told I had to pay the Feb. mortgage. I had to rush to the bank to get the money in my checking account. I was now told that I would get the money back but, as of yet I have not received the Feb. mortgage money back.

The website is easy to manage. I have set up autopay. My only problem was I was out of town when Amrock sent the checks to pay off my credit cards. They sat on my front porch in the rain. It seems in this time they could be paid electronically.,5
Brad,"York, PA","Reviewed March 12, 2021",I did not enjoy the high pressure. A decision about refinancing a mortgage should not just be a discussion with one person from one company who pressures you to move forward with what they think is best for you and then pressures you to provide your credit card number as a downpayment. The customer should have the option to evaluate other alternatives without feeling pressured to move forward with their refinancing option.,1
Osa,"Crownsville, MD","Reviewed March 12, 2021","Using Quicken loans/Rocket was a delightful, no pressure experience. This being our 3rd experience with the loan process, it was definitely the best.

Steven,"Atascadero, CA","Reviewed March 10, 2021",My wife and I decided to refinance our home about 2 months ago. The woman my wife spoke with made the process sound easy and said we could have everything done in a single phone call. I’m a 1099 contractor so I know most financial institutions are confused by my tax filing status so I was skeptical. Once we have her all the documents and bank statements she asked for we felt confident. She asked for a $500 dollar deposit and said once we were approved then we would get the money back. ,1
Grisselda,"Springfield, OR","Reviewed March 10, 2021",Working with Quicken Loans was such a fast and easy experience. I will definitely recommend them to family and friends.

I would never go through this again.,1
Lauren,"Milford, DE","Reviewed March 8, 2021","Everything was done online including setting up when to meet with the lawyer.

Brett,"West Columbia, TX","Reviewed March 5, 2021","Worst. Company. Ever. DO NOT under any circumstances use these people to refinance. They handled my refinance well, got me a lower monthly rate and little bit better term...or so I thought. Turns out after having them for almost a year, that they missed one of my required insurance policies during the refinance (keep in mind this affected my rate, one of my driving decisions to go through with it.) This is unbelievable to me because during the refinance process I actually had a joint call with Quicken and my insurance provider to make sure they had ALL the policies figured in the escrow payment. I even specifically asked about the insurance they missed. Now, after a year I'm short over $1K on my escrow and it took roughly 2 weeks to get them to call me. This is a TERRIBLE COMPANY and I would NEVER recommend them.",1
Randy,"Virginia Beach, VA","Reviewed March 5, 2021",This was a great experience for us. Everything was well organized and easy to understand. The Quicken team did a great job.

Roxana,"Artesia, NM","Reviewed March 5, 2021",We were very pleased with the whole process. I locked in a higher interest rate and when the rates went down they gave me the lower rate.

Tom,"Daly City, CA","Reviewed March 3, 2021","Quicken loan officers are very attentive and responsive. They will do whatever it takes to get you a loan or refinance your home, but it comes at a cost. In my case, they left out the possibility of having PMI insurance added to our loan. They decided to forego an appraisal because “it was in our best interest and it would have prolonged the closing”. Unfortunately, they did not disclose this until we made a complaint, and the loan was already closed. If we had known this before closing, we would have had the option to proceed with them or refinance with another lender. We trusted that they would provide full-disclosure and explain this rather than just adding it to our closing documents and blaming us that we did not fully read the loan documents. Yes, it was written somewhere in the dozens of pages filled with legalese wording, but as a large consumer lender, they should have been upfront and ethical in their practices by discussing this prior to signing.",1

The first associate I spoke with asked for basic financial information and quickly provided a contract with a low interest rate and requested a 'good faith' deposit of $500. Then the nightmare started. As an engineer for a high tech company, a large part of my compensation is based on awarded company shares that vest quarterly. NONE of these proclaimed financial experts, from a self proclaimed top national lender had any idea what a restricted stock unit (RSU) is and how it works, and worse, they didn't understand even after I walked them over the documents. It felt that they had very little or no prior financial knowledge whatsoever.",1

I was so confused as to what was important and what was repeat requests for items/steps that were already submitted. Had no specific contact point to ask questions, always routed to different folks. On initial contact about refi I asked for payoff and $5000 extra as I planned on a little landscaping. When Dalton called and said something along the lines that refi and $1000 looked good. I was a little disappointed but wasn't going to make a deal killer out of it. There was so much confusion that I was ready to cancel the whole refi, but the wife said she would handle it. Should I ever have to finance another place it would not be on-line.",3

Everyone reading this PLEASE check your Closing Disclosure documents and call your county taxes to make sure they are paid and if they paid the correct amount and if it is over see where that overage has gone. So I was doing my taxes today and noticed that my 1098 didn't have my taxes that I paid and my first step was to call Quicken which they said, ""Yes that is correct. We do not put that on properties we close."" It is on the Closing Disclosure document which they helped me login and get that number. I then wanted to double check with the Sheriff to ensure it was paid and guess what? It was not paid and to add insult to injury the amount they collected from me to pay my taxes were 588.28 more than what I would owe. ",1
Katelyn,"Anchorage, AK","Reviewed Feb. 10, 2021",Overall the experience that I had was really good but there were so drawbacks.

I was supposed to close at the end of December but didn't end up closing until the end of January. They waited 16 days after we gave them a new title company to get the ball rolling with them which was the reason it was pushed back so far. They were very nice and answered all of my questions but they lacked in those areas.,4

Then the amount turned into an application fee. No other company has charged this and I've owned 5 houses and refi'd 3 times. I even chatted with someone named Destiny who kept insisting that I speak with the original loan officer when I made it clear I wanted to speak to a different person.

Quicken Loans not only took nearly 7 months to close but also showed us that they have no basic decent business practices. When we finally were closing, our lawyer showed us that we were charged twice for a 2nd appraisal that did NOT happen. When I brought this up to Quicken Loans, they thought an acceptable solution would be to give us back less than half of the cost of the double appraisal fee and for them to keep the rest... For example: When someone steals $100 out of your pocket and offers you $25 back... To my husband and I that is unacceptable business practices. When I asked them why it took nearly 7 months to close, I was met with ""there was miscommunication"". ",1
Ruth,"Hanford, CA","Reviewed Jan. 21, 2021","Our experience was wonderful. From the time we started the process until closing. Everything was so easy and smooth.

I highly recommend Quicken Loans.",5
Thomas,"Okemos, MI","Reviewed Jan. 20, 2021","Sydney, loan officer, was very good throughout the process. Rocket Mortgage closing team did a very good job and the closing documents were prepared without any mistakes. The only issue is with the underwriting team.. They appear to be inexperience, unable to read financial statements, understand CH S corporation and how wages and profits are reported on form 1120S, W-2s and K-1s and slow. Had to update P&Ls 2x since the originals were emailed.",5
Anthony,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed Jan. 20, 2021","The overall loan experience was great. My only issue was the amount of documentation required for the loan that I had never had to provide for previous loans with Quicken. At times, the requested documentation was vague and required additional communication to understand exactly what was being requested.",4
Megan,"Findlay, OH","Reviewed Jan. 19, 2021","When I filled out a form online just to check how much I could save monthly by refinancing, I had NO intention to do so that day. John called and talked me into it. The process was so easy, how could I not? But also if at any point had I been dissatisfied, I would've stopped, because again, I hadn't planned on it. I got whiny during the day a few times; he used humor and appropriate prodding to keep me moving in the right direction. Closing was painless, and appraisal was waived. I used to think Quicken Loans wasn't a ""real"" mortgage company but I feel totally different about it now. I will recommend to others.",5

Bravo to the Quicken team.",5
James And Juliet,"Toano, VA","Reviewed Jan. 16, 2021","I was impressed with Monty when he called the first time; however, things went a little sideways from there on. The process felt VERY impersonal and rushed. I was never quite sure all the correct papers had been received. There was no ""hometown banker"" just a voice on the phone. The appraiser was very nice but business like. The speed with which the refinance was accomplished was overwhelming. The worst part of the entire process was the closing. The person, Dr. Dan ** was rude, curt, non-communicative and abrupt. He did not or could not answer questions and was very surly in his demeanor. If he was the ""face of the company"", shame on the company.",3

Daniel,"Charlotte, MI","Reviewed Jan. 6, 2021",Outside of refinance taking 4 months and being handed off to other people we were pleased. All questions were answered. The waiting was the worst part.

We can now work on improving our financial picture. Thank you.,5
Aj,"West Warwick, RI","Reviewed Jan. 6, 2021","The paperwork was easy. All electronic was easy. Some pieces of the paperwork needed explanation and I couldn’t find answers till after closing. I was asked to reach out to my older lender for payoff balance as it was the harder part from what I was told. The process could be faster. It took 4 months, which was more than twice the time that was said. Client reps could be more accessible and responsive. These are resolvable and not earth shattering... so I would still recommend Quicken and won’t hesitate to work with it again, should I have need for it.",4
Christopher,"Antioch, CA","Reviewed Jan. 6, 2021","I started the refi process at the end of August 2020. The original close date I was told would be in October, but the loan didn't close until December 18, 2020. To be fair, the people I spoke to were pleasant, and they lowered my interest rate from the start of the process even further, just days before closing, to get me a better rate. There were some issues with communication regarding a subordination agreement they needed from our solar company to close on the initial October date I was given. I wasn't told about it until I called a couple days after the original October date had passed. I was able get that to them that day. The communication seemed to be pretty good from that point forward. There was still some waiting, and this Covid-19 situation may have played a part, but again, they were able to give me an even better interest rate!",4

Katherine,"Denver, CO","Reviewed Jan. 5, 2021","This is my third experience with Quicken Loans. For this experience 90% of the interactions, were performed electronically with only a few contacts with individuals. However, Nicole, my initial contact was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and patient with all my questions. The loan ""dialogue"" regarding what was needed from me was generally seamless. My one recommendation might be that the language used regarding what was being requested might be a little more end user friendly as finance is not my forte'. However, any questions I had about items requested were promptly clarified and answered. I was a able to upload the necessary documents.",5

Heather,"San Diego, CA","Reviewed Dec. 13, 2020","Overall, my experience was good, particularly the ease of closing. HOWEVER, 3 things did fall below my expectations: 1) my rate expired 3 times and I had to REQUEST extension disclosures, it was not automatic and timely. I understand volume is/was high during COVID due to interest rates, but you should default to 90 day locks right now to avoid rework/re-disclosures. 2) I notified my Client Team of vacation time and closing impacts, but that was not registered in my file.

He answered all my questions. I chose to go with quicken loans for 2 reasons. The rate was good, but the biggest reason was that Chris was easy to communicate with. I dealt with other companies and felt like I was a child being talked to. Chris was always respectful and I liked that he would allow me to text him since I have a toddler and being on the phone is hard. I also liked the whole process of doing everything on the app and the closing agent coming to my house was so much better than me having to drag my family somewhere.

Regardless, I made the decision to execute the terms and I wouldn’t have done so if I wasn’t ok with it. Like I said, just would’ve liked him to be more knowledgeable in assisting.",4

I told him I was shopping rates and closing cost and that I would be interested to hear his offer.

Quickly they took $500.00 that was non refundable. At the very end of a month and a half, got a call that the underwriters would not process as there was a document from the IRS I needed. No problem except I had to complete the IRS document and send it back to them before getting another in return. The one returning wouldn't be for another 10 weeks.

Our closing costs got corrected the day before our closing which was never communicated with Amrock and resulted in confusion on closing day and higher costs being taken out (later returned) but thankful we had that extra in our checking account or it could have resulted in bank fees.

Stephen,"Los Alamos, NM","Reviewed Nov. 25, 2020",Be careful when dealing with their Mortgage Bankers. Their job is to lure you in with promises and they like to play with the numbers to make their offer look better than others only to have the numbers switch back when you get your final paperwork. They like to use the term estimate but when you provide them exact numbers for property taxes and insurance they say that you're paying too much and adjust the numbers down to make their estimated monthly payment less than a competitor. However the number will revert back to the original ones when you get ready to close. So their payment now matches what the other company was offering.,1

The verbal is what I had counted on and I should have been more observant so that was on me so it was disappointing as I was going to do some update on my home with extra. It’s always a wonderful experience with Quicken and the signing but I will advise others to be more observant of final paperwork instead of just the verbal.",4

It is so wonderful to work with people over the phone who know what they’re doing and can speak clearly and properly. You have a great staff and they all treat me as if I were their very own special customer. Good job!!!! You people work for a great company!",5
Heather,"Shrewsbury, PA","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2020","Started out good, gave us a great rate. We submitted everything they asked for and we were on our way. (BTW, this is the 2nd company we tried to refi with, the first one was the cause of us being late on our mortgage payment for the first time in 15 years, told us not to pay it because we were closing at the end of month). Fast forward to this company and 4 months later, they are still asking us for stuff, over and over again. The same stuff...over and over. We are throwing in the towel, initial purchase of our house was not this difficult. It is actually ridiculous!!",1

Heather,"Manheim, PA","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2020",From start to finish it was the smoothest process and closing we have ever had! We barely had to do anything to get us approved and closed. It was also nice that the title agent came directly to our house instead of having us go to them. Thank you.,5

David,"Weaverville, NC","Reviewed Nov. 22, 2020","Our first mortgage with Quicken went smoothly and quick. Our refinance dragged on for months. The end result was fine, but the process seemed to go on forever. We weren't seeking a refinance, but were talked into it. Great rate, but it meant extending our mortgage out to 30 years. There was some disconnect too about how much cash we would need at closing. We don't have a lot of money on hand to fork over some $3900. We were told at the beginning it would be somewhere around $37 by rolling our current escrow with Quicken into the new loan. Ultimately, it was a much smaller amount, but not without some back and forth over how that was to be.",4

I reviewed and approved the Closing Disclosure Package (attached) sent out on 10/28 and was expecting to have this wrapped up shortly thereafter. I was then notified there was an issue regarding a lien that did not even exist as of 10/23/2020 as notated in the attached document provided by Progressive Title. There was a week of back and forth from QLMS about an issue that was not even real or true. They said they could not close the refi until the issue was resolved which there was no issue to resolve.

I'm self employed and my husband has a regular job. We were assured this would be ok and we'd get it done before the payoff date. They charge you a ""good faith deposit"" to cover any costs if you cancel before closing. Weird, but ok. We checked the website multiple times a day for required documents.

Walter,"Fountain Inn, SC","Reviewed Nov. 3, 2020",My banker Darren ** was a great help to us and answered all our concerns. He was always available to us and would recommend him to anyone. Now the others who did all the paperwork for the loan was very lazy. I had to get all the paperwork for them that they should have gotten. It took over 60 days to verify my wife's employment and then she had to actually call her personnel manager to call Quicken to verify her employment. This loan should have closed 15 to 20 days earlier but there was a lot of laziness somewhere in the process.,4
Martin,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed Nov. 3, 2020",Took quite awhile to get it finished. Almost three months but with the covid that's probably why.

It's easy to upload documents and the advisers are always available to chat. They actually check in often to see if you have any questions and how the process is going. Everything seems very streamlined and intuitive. Document signing is easy and contact free in this time of covid. We only had to meet with one person to sign the final papers and they came to our house! So convenient.,5
Tara,"Puyallup, WA","Reviewed Nov. 2, 2020",The digital experience was very easy and limited contact. We were always updated and could track the progress.

This is not my first rodeo. I have refinanced before, but Quicken loans keeps stalling hoping to find something they can change or cancel the loan. They do not do what they say and for as far as I am concerned, they are using false advertisement. I think they just bring on new clients to be able to look good for their investors.

First going into forbearance we were told there would be three options when we decided to come out of this period. All three options never happened. No refinancing, no remodification and no deferred payments. The deferred payments are now a balloon mortgage at the end of the loan term. Which puts us in a really bad situation in seven years. We will have to borrow. Quicken loans is operating for their benefit only. Many people at the end of their mortgage term will have to sell their properties. Quicken loans mis-represented their forbearance offer. In difficult times, this mortgage company has now made it much more difficult.",1

We ask questions about why there is such a discrepancy, and the loan processor can not provide us with one coherent answer.

Adam,"Miami, FL","Reviewed Aug. 3, 2020","Quicken Loans is the worst company to do refinancing with. The appraisal that the company use is a crook and they always estimate at 100-150k lower the initial price. On top of that, you can NOT transfer the appraisal so you lose $500. I had my house listed for 662k with the appraisal of Quicken Loans (very low compared to Zillow) and a month later I got it priced for $782k with its competitor Amerisave Mortgage corporate. How can you explain that???? On top of that, their customer services are very bad and those salesmen are nothing but crook. Quicken Loans might be ranked number in Google because they spend a lot of money in the advertisement but trust me you are better off with them. Also, do NOT do any business with those 2 rude people: -Muhammad ** -Adam **. Both of them are very sneaky and act like they are professional but at the end of the day, they are just trying to rip you off!!!",1

After 4 weeks, our loan application was still processing. Every day, they requested 10 new papers, and every time it took 3 days to review them. We had to take time from work just to collect all the documents they required. 10 days and 3 extensions later, our loan was still processing. We never got the approval or denial - just processing. We finally had to abandon our application and borrow money from the family to close the escrow, because the sellers were not willing to wait any longer. Terrible company.",1

shawn,"Jersey City, NJ","Reviewed July 30, 2020","Rocket Mortgage is great if you just need a prequalification letter and you want to lock in a mortgage rate quickly. The initial document request is standard. Once they get your money and the process for getting the appraisal started is when this process falls apart. Rocket Mortgage does not tell you that after they receive the initial documents that request for more data and details will continue up until the last day before closing. Also, you own part of a company or full into a certain classification, you probably will never close and you will lose the house you want to buy and you won't get a mortgage. You can just following up on their request and eventual you will get approved, unless you have a 50 to 60 day contract, forget about it. ",1

Not telling me about a termite inspection until a few days before the loan was allegedly to fund. VA rules are set in stone the letters size of Mount Rushmore. How do you miss that. Incompetent is how. Then for who knows what after I resolved the termite inspection it sat in their probate waiting legal to do the loan docs. Now the pièce de résistance the loan took a blistering 3 and a 1/2 months to close. So if you're in a hurry fellow veterans run as fast as you can from this loan agency.

The insurance company informed Quicken a policy for the type of building (60-floors) I resided, the policy could not be written to their specification even though this was a 5-star insurance company.

Mohamed,"Carbondale, IL","Reviewed May 31, 2020","I have a wonderful credit score of 808. When I applied for home mortgage, my lender representative used to answer my requests and calls frequently. Once, he pushed me to sign the Mortgage agreement, he stopped responding to my messages and emails. I was misled in many ways, he proposed a low interest rate with closing cost of about 6% of the total loan. Most of them for purchasing discount points. Everyone told me that this is a rip off, with my financial credit, the closing cost should not exceed 3% of the total loan. I tried to cancel my loan application but they never responded. Be aware, don't be fooled by low down payment and low interest rate, Always ask about closing cost. They are not working for you. They are working to maximize their profit. Never let them push you to sign documents, always take your time. If you can get financed thru your local bank, It is 100% better than dealing with those guys.",1

We would have to leave one year of the student loan off the new mortgage amount, totaling 10,000. This was late Friday afternoon. Broker Ted ** said he’d call me back Monday to see how we wanted to handle this new information. He never bothered to call us back, he had my $500.00 and that’s what matters to them.

They may even admit on recorded phone calls that this is largely their own fault in not just one mistake but multiple but still say that you must pay the difference for their error(s). Your only fault will be that you didn't catch their errors when they made them.

It was taken care of, after the appraisal, when I talked to the so called workout specialist, once he told me he had submitted loan to the underwriter, next he told me he had not gotten the appraisal, that was done two weeks before, two months after all the jerking around they inform me they could not do loan due to debt to income, they are lost in space, a real waste of time and effort, do yourself a favor.

Dustin,"Mission Viejo, CA","Reviewed March 18, 2020","I called Quicken to look into refinancing my current mortgage.

I have excellent credit and income and have never missed a payment in the 10 years of having my current loan. The loan officer said ""those closing costs are the going rate right now because of the high demand of refinances"". So because there is a demand for refinances, you are allowed to price gouge on your rates and fees?! Good luck! Terrible business practices. I would never recommend Quicken to anyone.",1
Andy,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed March 17, 2020","At first Quicken told me that I was losing money.

My credit score is above 800 and I have enough cash on hand to buy the property several times over without a loan. It basically boiled down to me being self-employed. Somehow me buying the business that used to employ me, having a score above 800, having a 12 year history of paying several mortgages on time and in full every month, and having an abundance of cash is seen as high risk.

The appraiser had done a shoddy job and relied on comps from a different neighborhood with a completely different profile of homes. We tried to dispute the appraisal to no avail. In the end the cost of my refinance was $10K more than the initial estimate because of the lower appraisal. I went with another lender and the appraisal was $90K higher than Quicken Loans. Not as quick as Rocket mortgage/ quicken loans but WAY cheaper. Closing costs were 1/3rd of quicken loans and the rate was at par.

Michaela,"Safety Harbor, FL","Reviewed Oct. 10, 2019","In my experience, usually the loan to value (LTV) ratio is 80% of the appraised value. In Quicken's book, it is 80% of the appraised value or the sales price, whichever is lower. Anything less than 80%, the buyer must pay a Private Mortgage Insurance premium (PMI). I sold my house to my son in August, 2019 and gave him an equity letter for his down payment with the intent that he would have an 80% LTV. He opted to pay all of the closing costs which reduced the LTV to less than 80%. I would have been okay with a PMI at that point, but apparently, I sold it for less than the appraised value. Now Quicken refuses to remove the PMI charge because the sales price is the lowest value keeping the ratio below 80%. Be careful. Quicken does not follow industry standards.",1

Moustapha,"East Greenwich, RI","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2019","I would not recommend Quicken to anyone. One of the worst customer service ever. Don't be fooled by the fancy commercials. I had a mortgage with them for about 2 years now. 1 of my tax bill from the city was not delivered and was sent to them. They immediately established an escrow account and increased my monthly payment. I contacted them and try to resolve and even sent them proof of tax payment but no way. They treat you as a delinquent customer. I have my monthly payment setup a month ahead recurring and have never been late. The answer I got from their ""executive team resolution"" when I said I would file a complaint with the Attorney General and I might go to Court, was that they have the legal means to go to any court.

L. C.,"Escondido, CA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2019","Quicken (also known as Rocket Mortgage) originated my refinance home loan. I had no problems with quicken until now. They transferred servicing my load to Loancare LLC. Loancare LLC charges fees for everything and the fee amounts are more than double including charging $15 to use their automated phone system. See attached photo for their fee schedule. A payoff statement is free for the mortgage I have with Third Federal. Quicken charges $25, Loancare charges $60! So, beware: at some point quicken will transfer your loan servicing to a firm whose business plan is to overcharge for everything (just checkout the Loancare LLC ratings). You may be happy with quicken/rocket but that won’t continue when they transfer your load to loancare llc.",1

Derek,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed July 6, 2019","I purchased a home and 6 months later they advised me they made a ""mistake"". They didn't include raves in our contract, but they are taxes, so I have to pay them. This ""mistake"" is costing me nearly %25 more. $450 a month, and nearly $100k more over the life of the loan. I contend had they done their job, and I would have known of this %25 more, I would not have signed the contract and thus would not owe these taxes, as this was clearly not in my budget. Has this happened to you? I want to know at **. I believe this ""mistake"" was made to make me sign the contract as it made the deal look good to me (in my budget) and the underwriter. Quicken received the tax information from the title company, just ""accidentally"" left it out of the contract. If this or something similar happened to you, I want to know.

Lauren,"Sanford, FL","Reviewed July 5, 2019","I had previously been with Quicken Loans and had a good experience; however, my boyfriend recently applied for a refi, and it did not go well. After going through the paperwork, he initially signed for the loan. However, the company he already had his loan with gave him a better rate, so he called back Quicken to cancel. In the meantime, the appraiser called to come out and he said no since the process was already in cancellation. They said he would not be charged the $500 since the loan was cancelled and the appraisal didn't take place. Well, like a lot of people going through the same thing on here, they charged him and now the guy, Jessie from Quicken, won't return his calls. This is a complete scam that Quicken has. No matter if you cancel or not, they will keep the $500 appraisal fee. I can certainly see a class action lawsuit coming against this company very soon.",1

I provided the loan officer with all the information from the bank I had been working with. She came back with a mortgage interest rate that was significantly higher than what I was promised with my other bank. I told her, unless Quicken could meet or beat, I was not interested. The Quicken loan officer tried to deflect, saying she needed to do a comparison of closing costs, so I provided her with the detailed closing cost estimate. At no point in our discussion did the Quicken loan officer offer to meet or beat the rate I was given. I told her I was going to stay with the bank with the lowest interest rate. She told me ""good luck"" and that was the last I hear from her. Needless to say, Quicken's offer of the $250 Visa card never materialized.

I told that agent that I did not want a hard pull on the credit unless I knew it would be worth the credit drop. I was promised that it would not have gotten kicked back to that particular person unless they could help me significantly because she was an account manager that could fast track my loan and it would not be kicked to her unless the company could greatly help me.

This seems like a pretty easy calculation based on the loan amount and the payments over the next 4 months. Why can't Quicken calculate the loan payoff for date certain 11/1/2019 (I asked on 6/25/2019).

However, when an appraiser who does not know your market, but desperately wants to retain their position with Quicken, you are essentially, setting 500 bucks on fire. Once you receive a truly incorrect, below all market trend appraisal, the loan officer who took your cc number brushes you off, as his cut of the 6k closing is out of the picture, as he/she sees it. The parameters are given to you to go out and find your own comps, which is the most important part of the appraisal. Once submitted, they send it directly to the original appraiser, whose reputation is at stake if he was wrong and you, your county, and your real estate agent, know nothing.

They tried pretty hard to sell me a loan that was waaaay worse off than my current situation. Even to suggest the loan as a reasonable alternative is negligent. To try and convince me that it would save me money (it raised my interest rates by about 6k per year (about 1.5%), extended my loan life by 5 years) and charge me 15k for the loan borders on criminal.

Scarlett,"Hyattsville, MD","Reviewed June 8, 2019","These are the VA requirements for a VA IRRRL. No appraisal or credit underwriting package is required when applying for an IRRRL. An IRRRL may be done with ""no money out of pocket"" by including all costs in the new loan or by making the new loan at an interest rate high enough to enable the lender to pay the costs. When refinancing from an existing VA ARM loan to a fixed rate loan, the interest rate may increase. No lender is required to give you an IRRRL, however, any VA lender of your choosing may process your application for an IRRRL. Veterans are strongly urged to contact several lenders because terms may vary. You may NOT receive any cash from the loan proceeds.

They helped me with any question that I had. I always knew I would and could turn to them no matter what time of day. And I liked how friendly they were when I had questions. I liked how they made me feel at ease during the during process. They are very good at what they do. I like them a whole lot. I would recommend them.,4
Heather,"Dunbar, WV","Reviewed June 4, 2019",Getting a loan or refinanced mortgage with Quicken Loans is easy. You should be familiar with their payment plans before contacting them. They will treat you like family and you can rest assured that they will take care of you. My experience with Quicken Loans has been incredible. They respect me and treat me like an equal. They are always on my side and I would not even have a home if not for them. I have liked the fact that they make me feel like a top priority to them. They support me and help me stay on task with my money.,5
Ric,"Rochester, MI","Reviewed June 4, 2019",Better known as Quick Mortgage. I recommend this organization to everyone. The process is very quick and never had a problem. The process to get a loan with Quick was a very easy process. Just give them a phone call and give them a very small list of your asset and your debts. This company is very easy to work with. Welcome to the 21st century. I think everyone should give Quicken mortgage a try for a home loan. A great Detroit Michigan company. So help Detroit out and get your loan from Quicken.,5
Glenn,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ","Reviewed June 4, 2019","From the beginning to the end Quicken Loans made the whole process very easy. They gave me a very quick approval and all of the details they gave me were extremely accurate. Their questions were easy to understand and they were very fast to respond to any questions that I had. Also, Quicken Loans made every effort to make me feel at ease. The person helping me was very professional.",5
Juan,"Stockton, MO","Reviewed June 4, 2019",My experience with Quicken Loans was adequate for me at the time. They were very quick to respond to my initial application and I really appreciated that service. I also liked how they made the entire application process more streamlined than other loan service and at that time this is exactly what I was looking for in a loan. The initial application was great and forthcoming but the follow up was in my opinion less than to be desired. They fell short on details that I was concerned about as it applied for my particular home at that time. I found that other customer services they offered were not as friendly as I would have hoped that they would be. After the initial application I found that they were hard to pinpoint on some details that I wanted to know about like selling loan to another creditor.,4
Justin,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed June 4, 2019",My mortgage with Quicken Loans was great. The application process was online and was very easy. They instantly verified my employment and income and offered me a custom fixed rate loan term that met my needs. They provide FHA backed loans and USDA loans as well as products offered by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that require payments as low as 3 percent.,4
Anisha,"Boston, MA","Reviewed June 4, 2019","My experience with Quicken loans has been an overall positive one. There has always been an open line of communication whenever I had any doubts, questions or concerns - they would always be helpful and customer service was great. I was always looked after and they made sure I understood all the terms and conditions. I liked that the people at Quicken Loans made refinancing my loan simple, there were no hidden fees or anything that was not discussed. And they helped me through every step of the process. Something that I disliked about Quicken Loans was that a couple of times I did not get notifications, and that left me in the dark about some things that I felt I should have known about. However when I talked to them about it they helped me change the settings so that I would get them. I would definitely recommend Quicken to anyone who wants to make their financial experience simplified.",4
Jeremy,"Tempe, AZ","Reviewed June 4, 2019","It was easy to apply and get approved for my mortgage. I think I got the best rate available which is always a nice thing to have. I liked the fact that I could do the entire application online because I sometimes have a work schedule that would prevent me from doing all of that in a physical branch. They have been easy to work with from the initial application process all the way through to getting the mortgage and buying a home. At first it was difficult to get more personalized service and they were a bit slow to respond. But after I was able to track down the process more closely, I haven't had any problems them since then.",4
Mike,"Bel Air, MD","Reviewed June 4, 2019",Honestly they were good at first but then I realize I would never ever tell me there's at least 12 ever companies that are way better. The interest rates were way too high. They are rude. They take so much time to finalize things. I hate them and wouldn't recommend them to my dogs.,1
Laura,"Bandon, OR","Reviewed June 4, 2019","Quicken Loans seems to be comparable to other mortgage companies. Quickens is faster in giving you information than the bank I dealt with in the past. They are friendly and knowledgeable. They are faster than a lot of banks, banks usually take 90 days or more, Quicken didn't take that long to give me the information on the loan that I needed or wanted. They answered any questions I had within a short time frame, nothing to dislike about them. The one thing I don't like about getting a loan with Quicken or anyone else is all the information they want. So many years of taxes, work experience, investment and such. I know they are loaning a large sum for a house, but it could be easier.",5
Julie,"Corbin, KY","Reviewed June 4, 2019",The experience has been beyond great. They helped with everything and made sure we got a great rate. They are super nice and friendly and go beyond and above to get what you need. They was easy to deal with and all the paperwork was made to be easy to understand. The process was pretty simple. We applied. Heard back from them in just a few days. Got the paperwork all rolling out and was approved so now we have a great place to live. We love our home now that we have that mortgage paid off. Would recommend them to anyone who needs a new mortgage loan.,5
Juan,"San Fernando, CA","Reviewed June 4, 2019",They have a really good standard and great rates that help every new homeowner learn more about what they need.. lots of loan products. I like the loan products availability because they show you a chart with rates that simply work with your down payment and they help you every step of the way. I liked everything that they had to offer. All of their services that they had were really amazing and they were very easy to get to know how to use them. Overall a good service company for your everyday home loans. They walk you through the entire process.,4
Dan,"Lady Lake, FL","Reviewed June 4, 2019",They made it very easy for me to tailor the mortgage to suit my needs. I was approved very quickly. The application process was easy and simple. I enjoyed the fact that I could apply online. I liked that my approval come so quickly. I liked that the application process was clear and straightforward. I liked that Quicken gave me a lot of confidence that they knew what they were doing. The website was easy to navigate. The pages loaded quickly. The information that was requested was always relevant. There was nothing unreasonable about the information that was asked of me. I felt like the secure would do a good job of keeping my data secure.,5
Bob,"Dothan, AL","Reviewed June 4, 2019","Quicken Loans is a good company to do business with. They help me with all that I need with my mortgage or anything else I would like. They offer many products if I need them and they offer much assistance with anything that I need. It is a good choice for me to know what I like in a lending institution. I want to know what it is for me. I like it a lot for me to know what I want in a mortgage lending company. I started online with an application and the place I wanted to buy. Then I spoke to a mortgage representative about what I wanted in a mortgage and they helped me get approved with the rate I wanted. However, I wish that they can offer more products in the way of a bank. I would like to see them offer more tools for me to have.",4
Lori,"Bradford, PA","Reviewed June 4, 2019","Easy to fill out forms with all needed information and answers to any questions and/or concerns we have. Fast approval and received the need qualification we wanted for the right amount. The mortgage was sent to a different provider which still has been good, easy to deal with, same rates and payment schedule. Accurate results. Ease of making payments. Easy to apply, get qualified and get the actual mortgage. Great customer service agents. Customer service is available when you need it.",5
James,"Citrus Heights, CA","Reviewed June 3, 2019",Decided to try them for refinance and get rid of the mortgage insurance on my original loan. Got a hold of them we gave all the info they asked for. They called back and insisted that a debt relief loan was the best for me. I said sure that could help. Then they said that I was going to have mortgage insurance again. Kind of defeats the whole purpose. I then said go ahead. I was charged $500.00 for appraisal and roof we went. House was appraised got a call back a snag occurred. We have solar panels on lease to own. A clause in the contract that stated if sold new buyer must have good credit to get the contract. I was told they did not like that clause and that I needed to get it changed. No luck there they said it should not change or prevent us to get refinance. Quicken then called and we were dropped from process. We are out the $500.00 we paid. Not cool. Buyers beware.,1
Susan,"Albuquerque, NM","Reviewed June 3, 2019","I recently made the mistake to search online into a refinance rate with Quicken Loans. I should have known better than to do so as the same thing happened before. Shortly after I inquired ONLINE, my phone began to ring repeatedly. I have not answered because I am either at work or not interested in speaking with someone on the phone at this time. Hence, why I researched online. I did not request a phone call. My phone has rang up to 7 times in one day and someone has called even on Saturday and Sunday. This is extremely poor business practice and can be construed as harassment. Quicken Loans- constantly calling someone is not a professional business practice and does nothing more than annoy and chase away a customer. What a shameful selling tactic!",1
Kimber,"Charleston, SC","Reviewed June 3, 2019","I contacted Quicken via Rocket Mortgage along with a few other lenders for pre-approval. I should have known from the get-go that it would be a bad experience as it was an act of Congress to get on the phone with the loan specialist handling the pre-approval. After finally getting him on the phone and talking through the details, the rates were better than what I'd been quoted before and so I decided to move forward.",1
Justin,"Tempe, AZ","Reviewed June 3, 2019",A family member of mine recommended I choose Quicken Loans for my mortgages and so far I can see why. They were so friendly and easy to work with. It did not take long before I worked out what I needed from them and I could not be more satisfied. My experience with them has been pretty good as they are cheap and always reliable. Their customer service has gone beyond my expectations and I enjoy their services. They are a very reliable service provider for my mortgages and personal needs. They always have my back and I trust them with their fantastic customer service and protection. I could complain about the price but it is in fact fairly low for what they have given me in terms of all the loans I have.,4
Jason,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Reviewed June 3, 2019",It was really amazing because this company is really responsible and have a good service customer. It was easy to obtain my mortgage with this company and i fell really comfortable with the result. Also people is really friendly and responsible. Have good offer and its easy to pay the mortgage because have the better fee of the market. The communication sometimes was complicated because a lot of people try to communicate for email and the best way to talk with the employee is for phone because the email is really overcrowded. First It was easy because I use the internet information for apply in the web page. After I called to an assessor and she explained me every step for obtain the mortgage. Every process was a little slow but I felt safe and it was really easy.,4
John,"Southaven, MS","Reviewed June 3, 2019",I liked how everything could be done online and in mere minutes. They were alright but I transferred my loan over to a real bank which worked out better in the end for me because the rates were less and the bank is in my hometown. All of it could be done online which is a huge time saver and they never gave me any problems but I think it is just better to work with a local bank I already had a relationship with. Nothing beats a face to face when needed.,3
Stephanie,"Jacksonville, FL","Reviewed June 3, 2019","My experience has been okay. The process of applying is simple and can be done online. If you qualify you receive a phone call outlining the entire process. Then you receive a package in the mail about how they appraise your property. The process is somewhat lengthy but worth it if you are in need of a mortgage. Good customer service, fair loan rates. The loan rates have been consistent, but are a bit expensive in my opinion. Otherwise I can't complain. I would most likely recommend Quicken Loans to others if they qualify. High interest rates means high payments, so watch out when applying.",3
Chris,"Conroe, TX","Reviewed June 3, 2019",My experience has been really great. The support is very quick in answering all my question one time and the rates all their terms and at a great rate and their customer support and website are fantastic.

Samantha,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed June 3, 2019","When I went to the branch asking about my loan they helped me very quickly. They sat me down in a office, gave me food and drinks. We have a great discussion on how I can improve my situation. The loan was far more than I expected which I was very grateful for and I received my loan in my account within 24 hrs. I really enjoyed using them. They helped me greatly and I feel that they have great rates to make it affordable to pay back. They offered me a 45000 loan and I paid it back within 2 years and I have excellent credit with them. They are very trustworthy. They gave me a great loan and made me feel like I wasn’t just out here signing papers. I feel they have a great customer service base and they are very reliable. The process they offered were very reliable and good to me. Made me feel at home. No surprise fees. Everything was explained and made me feel great.",5
Neema,"Walnut, CA","Reviewed June 3, 2019","Quicken Loans was the first mortgage company I have used. I have never had an issue with them and they are always easy to reach when I have questions. It was very easy to apply online with Rocket Mortgage. The whole process being online makes it fast and easy. The biggest benefit is that it is an online process that is just as good as another local company. I like that they have made financial matters easy for people to understand. Even as a new homeowner I was able to understand the process through them. I like how straightforward the process is. I thought I would want to visit a brick and mortar place, but Quicken has made that unnecessary.",4
Steven,"Lake Elsinore, CA","Reviewed June 3, 2019","The process was detailed but they tried to make it as user friendly as possible. I had a relatively good experience considering the nature of mortgages which involve a lot of paperwork. They made the paperwork process efficient and explained everything that needed to be done. They made supplying documents easy through their online process. I liked the mostly online process because it allowed me to do things at my own pace without having to go into a branch every few days or hours. The process was well explained and I had a representative that I could contact for questions. But I would have liked to have had a more realistic time frame on the closing process, although I know it can be difficult to estimate.",5
Jen,"Mount Pleasant, TX","Reviewed June 3, 2019",First they estimate my mortgage and we make comparison online with other residential mortgage lenders. Then if you qualified they give you specific loan requirements at the time of application and results may vary. They have no state restrictions. The taxes and insurance wasn't included. The exact interest will depend on the date you lock your rate.,5
Rob,"Jacksonville, FL","Reviewed June 3, 2019","Great company. Very friendly, very knowledgeable, know their stuff and customers. The process was fast, quick, simple.He just got my info, asked me questions and about my credit history, checked it out online and validate some stuff and then we worked on a long term mortgage.. very easy and a painless. But I found a company with a better deal and lower interest rate. I asked them if they would match offer and they said they couldn't, ""sorry we can't do that sir."" So I went with a different company... It's all about saving money money.",3
Angie,"Booneville, MS","Reviewed June 3, 2019",It is just a stressful time buying a new house but Quicken did everything they could on their part to make it seamless.

John,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Reviewed June 3, 2019",Quicken Loans has a great service. At the process of mortgage I like the starting process. The form were easy to solve. The process of mortgage was very easy and clear to me. I like the rates of Quicken Loans. Additionally I like the customer service of the firm. They helped me much. Their rates are affordable. Overall good experience with them. But the time period of the mortgage process were pretty long. I think it should be shorter. And I hope that they will decrease their rates.,5
Elizabeth,"West Union, OH","Reviewed June 3, 2019",It was positive a very reliable company. They have great rates and they treat you the way you want. Make you feel comfortable. They are very welcoming and they treat their people like family. I will definitely use them again. When you call with a problem they are very quick to help you fix it and they are very polite with you about it. Their workers are the best I have encountered. They are very well mannered. You going or online and put in your application. They process all your info and give you an estimated time it will take to get back to you. They ask your preferred method of contact and they contact you when the application has been accepted or rejected.,5

I have told several friends and they all have switched and saved money.",5
Melody,"Bunnlevel, NC","Reviewed June 3, 2019",Easy to pay. Good online presence. Online servicing goes well. They have a good rate. I like that they let me refinance and it was easy. It was easy to get someone on the phone. We were able to drop our rate easily. They made it easy. Came to us with all the paperwork. The sales people are my biggest complaint. We just refinanced and they call all the time trying to get us to refinance. And they are pushy. Just stop it. Their sales people harass me at least once a month and I ** hate that.,4
Chris,"Hackettstown, NJ","Reviewed June 3, 2019","It's just like any other company really. You can do a few preliminary steps, but eventually you just decide your plan and apply. From there Quicken takes care of most of it for you and guides you easily through. It has been rather simple and straightforward. No issues were had making payments or contacting the company. I havent been too worried either which is always a plus. It has always been high quality and exceeded my expectations. I've rarely or never had complaints about them and any issues are always resolved way faster than I would have thought.",5

Adrian,"Hyattsville, MD","Reviewed June 3, 2019",Quicken Loans provided me with a complete home buying experience as it provided everything I felt like I needed to be approved for my home purchase. I received all of the help that I needed to establish terms and conditions for my home buying experience and I felt like I was treated with respect. I liked that Quicken Loans provided more information about the process from beginning to end. They were able to help me decide which options were appropriate for my financial situation and other services which would ultimately apply to my contract or mortgage terms. Quicken Loans will help everyone directly through the home buying process without any hassle.,3
Justin,"Houston, TX","Reviewed June 3, 2019",It was a challenge but well worth it. It seemed okay to start with bit after time. The thing that I did like about the loan agency is that is was quick and easy to fill out all aspects of the application. It took no time to have me approved which I guess is the standard so they can get your processes going. It is very easy to obtain the agreements with the company. But the hard part is fulfilling these agreements due to the price semantic on the return of the property. A problem arose with price inflation at every turn. The places are designed to keep you in a long term debt while paying the most for interest and fees. Also it is very expensive and does take the time to explain why it is so expensive. But it will cause you to question your description of what home loan means.,3
Kimmi,"Riverdale, GA","Reviewed June 3, 2019","In the beginning the experience was really good. I was a bit nervous that things wasn’t going to go thru. So with a little bit of research and hard work I finally got linked with Quicken Loans and things went by fast and approval was on time. You find your home and contact who you like to go through with your loan then have them take a look at your home. Then you send them the offer for the house and they will let you know if they are gonna accept and buy the home for you. I liked how the employees really cared about me. They helped things go fast and smoothly. It took about two weeks to get approved, but once approved was able to move into new home after inspection process. They didn’t take me through anything that I didn’t need to go through. I wasn’t forced into anything. I was gave a fair pay back price. Luckily everything worked out in everyone’s favor and I’m happy of that. I didn’t want to keep doing applications over and over.",4

Nesha,"Shreveport, LA","Reviewed June 2, 2019",I felt that my Quicken Loans experience was a learning experience. The only reason that I dealt with them because a family member had some pretty good things to say about them. I feel that as a company they had pretty good loan options and the interest rates weren't that high and I also felt the employees were very experienced and knew exactly what they were talking about. My experience has been pretty great. They had a pretty good interest rate compared to other mortgage companies.

I did appreciate the representatives being helpful and letting me know what was needed to ensure a smooth process. It was a self-explanatory process. They made me feel confident that I was getting the best loan for my needs. I also received plenty of communication during the process. I was approved for an amount that would cover the house I wanted. The interest rate was very satisfactory. It was a somewhat quick process and it made my home buying experience much easier. I do wish the interest rate had been a bit lower considering I have stable employment, good credit and good payment history.",5
Aaron,"Paintsville, KY","Reviewed June 2, 2019",The first thing I did was visit the website and review the information available to determine if it was a good choice for a loan.

Antoine,"Decatur, GA","Reviewed June 2, 2019","Quicken Loans has always delivered on their promises and terms and gave me the upmost respect in terms of customer satisfaction. They have always presented me with all the tools I need to a successful home owner. I liked the fact that Quicken Loans gave me tools to express my concerns about home ownership, and they never dropped the ball in giving me the leeway to give them everything I have to complete my process. They deliver on all of their terms, but they were slow in delivering. Like different quotes I requested were slow in returning my calls on. Anyone considering using Quicken Loans should consider the speed at which they want their process to be. Quicken Loans is a good company in my opinion but they were just slow in getting back with me on some of our terms such as loans, quotes, etc.",4
Adam,"Bellflower, CA","Reviewed June 2, 2019","They have acted in a very professional and courteous manner with regards to my mortgage experience.

I liked that I could do almost everything online and I could go at my own pace with filling everything out.

Patricia,"Anniston, AL","Reviewed June 2, 2019",My experience with Quicken Loans was great. The staff was extremely easy to work with and answered all our questions. The loan process (applying and getting approved) was super quick and super simple. We applied online for our loan and received the approval very quickly. Once the approval came through we were able to get all necessary documents ready for the purchase. We were able to get approved and get the mortgage much sooner than anticipated. I have not been part of a simpler process before. Everyone was very knowledgeable and quick to provide assistance whenever needed. Very few documents were needed and the company helped us in every step of the process. There was nothing that I disliked in any way shape or form about the loan process through Quicken.,5
Ken,"Aliso Viejo, CA","Reviewed June 2, 2019","I once refinanced with Quicken Loans and it was a very smooth refinance, therefore it was a good experience overall and I don't have any complaints or issues with their loan processing. I applied for the loan online and although I talked to an agent from time to time, most of the loan processing was done online and through email.",5
William,"Shepherdstown, WV","Reviewed June 2, 2019","I really liked how Quicken Loans, a company that helped me and some other people that I know, with the mortgages, is very very quick at getting to me and my friends who were also using Quicken Loans. They live up to their name, being very quick. I highly recommend you to do your loans with this company. The people there were extremely nice, and understood how me and their customers felt. I liked how the people helping me with my loans. Quicken Loans was so amazing!!!! They told the truth to me 100 percent of the time I was there. There was a miscommunication with the amount of loans that I owed, but I got refunded that money back.",5
Sal,"Portland, OR","Reviewed June 2, 2019","I would describe the process of getting a mortgage or refinancing your loan with Quicken Loans as an overall positive experience that left me confident in Quicken Loans more than I had been in the past. I liked when the process finalized, as I overall usually dread dealing with it. I appreciated about Quicken Loans in particular - the aspects such as their convenience, their consistent updates, their ability to provide customer service and immediate feedback at most hours, and their ability to import documents in many different formats and styles.",5
Fred,"Haledon, NJ","Reviewed June 2, 2019","We do not really like to carry a loan on the property and the process is time-consuming and lengthy to set up a loan. May take some time and effort to accomplish. All in all, there is a lot of paperwork involve. An individual should be prepared for a large amount of paperwork and investigation into credit histories and property details. But easy to do business with and has a good website and app. Good service, low loan rates. We had the ability to monitor the loan online and never fell behind in payments.",5
Taylor,"Lancaster, CA","Reviewed June 1, 2019",I had a really good experience with them. The process of receiving a home mortgage loan was quick and easy. I like how I was able to get a low interest rate. I also like how helpful their employees are in making the process quick and easy. I was able to apply online and do everything virtually. I was able to communicate through email and phone and the whole process was done virtually. I don't like that they have certain limits on how much they can lend you. I would have preferred if I could have gotten my entire mortgage loan from them.,5
Michael,"Denver, CO","Reviewed June 1, 2019","I applied for a loan with my mobile phone after seeing an advertisement on the television. I was approved pretty quickly and within a few weeks I was closing on my house. It was a pretty seamless experience. There are several things that I liked about my experience with Quicken Loans. Their online portal was so easy to use and most of it was done with my mobile device. There was nothing that I disliked about my experience with Quicken Loans. If anything, I would say that their fees were higher than average. But that is to be expected I suppose. They were a great company to work with. They had excellent customer service and they were available every step of the way during the mortgage process. I would absolutely use them again for my next mortgage.",4
Elyse,"Somerville, MA","Reviewed June 1, 2019","My experience has been exceptional. It was a quick approval and I got the amount I wanted for my home. I love them and would use them, again. I would also recommend them based on excellent rates. I found the application process a very easy one to work with. I was able to secure a rate that was helpful for me and I was able to buy a large home of my dreams. Sometimes I would much rather prefer to work with a loan officer in person, but, I was able to get the help that I need to buy what I wanted. I was able to secure a line with some documentation, on the site. It took only a matter of minutes to get a predetermined amount and then when I uploaded the documents I went beyond the preapproval to get a large rating than what I had anticipated.",5
Gary,"Lumberton, TX","Reviewed June 1, 2019","However, there is some things I disliked like the paperwork was not great at looking and getting to know everything about it and it could be more narrowed down and simplified for people. But they are great and a good selection as I needed their services and they are a great company and would recommend them anytime and like to come back to get the ** I need.",5
Michael,"Greenville, OH","Reviewed June 1, 2019","It has been a great experience, it has been so easy to use and I absolutely love it very very much. It is a great tool for loans and the like. It has been easy to sign up and find out if you qualify and it is quick and user friendly. It could be easier to use than it is now even though it is very user friendly. It can be hard to get into first, but once you're used to it it's very very very good. I tell everyone to use it if they can, it is the best tool for loans.",4
Sean,"Springfield, LA","Reviewed June 1, 2019","It has been good. They have good communication. Overall, I never felt like I was confused during the process. I never felt like they tried to deceive me. Everything felt convenient. During the entire process they made sure to stay in contact with me to make sure I understand everything as I move forward. I think the entire process overall is very easy and convenient to do. They're very helpful and communicate well. Only issue I'd say is they're inconsistent on how each representative is knowledgeable. I had to personally change mine. I thought that the first representative I talked to wasn't quite as knowledgeable as I thought they would be. I actually had to change that aspect through the process and ended up talking to a second person to help.",4
Erik,"San Jose, CA","Reviewed June 1, 2019","Surprising, at first customer service was a bit behind the times but in the last year they have improved and the overall company has gotten much better. Better service, low APR and easy payment options. Overall Quicken has surprised me at the level of individual service that I have received. Minimal paperwork, decent digital format, well educated customer service representatives and easy application process. Overall application process was long but secure.",3
Andy,"Solvang, CA","Reviewed June 1, 2019","It has been very professional. They are easy to work with, and they give good rates. I liked how easy it was to get started online. I liked how helpful the materials online were to get me to figure out each next step that I had to do from application to completion. I liked how streamlined the process was, from application to approval to setting up the repayment plan. They have a fairly sophisticated system which made it all go off without a hitch. The repayment plan has also been relatively stress-free. But you do not have the kind of personal relationship that you would have at your local bank with a dedicated agent, but that is not too much of a drawback.",4
Ray,"Elk Grove Village, IL","Reviewed June 1, 2019","It was surprisingly easy to apply with Quicken Loans. I applied online and got a call within hours. But when I spoke on the phone, he gave me lots of paperwork to fill out and it was slightly stressful but I was able to get approved. I was easily approved and was contacted by the representative nearly minutes after completing the application. It was an easy process online, but not easy while filling out manual paperwork. I would like to have in phone guidance with the representatives on the phone. The paperwork took me hours to complete and needed advice to fill it out. Also, it feels like they are pushy and hard to negotiate with a lower interest rate.",3
Molly,"Skowhegan, ME","Reviewed June 1, 2019","Streamlined and easy to understand process. Top advertised company. A lot of commercials over the years on TV and online and radio. Large presence. Trusted and backed by time. Good mobile apps. Easy to contact and quickly available staff, in a customer-facing company, with many years experience. Friendly staff when interaction was needed. My Home Loan Expert changed my life. Asked some questions about my mortgage goals. They'll work to set realistic expectations up front and make sure I clearly understood the steps of the process.",5
Todd,"Louisburg, NC","Reviewed June 1, 2019",I feel that experience was a pretty decent one. First I had to contact the representative then I had to apply for the loan and they checked my credit history which took quite a bit of time but I was not displeased when I got the loan. I feel that if you were willing to wait you would be fine. I got my loan and was approved with some really good speed and I was able to afford the loan and pay it back relativity easily. I feel that they have a lot going for them. I like the amount of effort they put into everything in order to run this business. It's really easy. It makes me feel that my time as a consumer isn't wasted. But I had to wait quite a bit in order to get the loan and be approved the first time I applied for one.,5
Albert,"Levelland, TX","Reviewed June 1, 2019",Decent and kinda worth it. Liked the list of things they shown that shown what good options were there to check and to select what was the better choice to work with and might check out again if there was another option to. Been ok but could've been better doing with a company that is talked about a lot for something that they were really good at doing and giving information about.,3
Jimi,"Bastrop, LA","Reviewed June 1, 2019","Quicken Loans is an amazing company, they completed the mortgage process (a VA loan) faster than I have ever had a loan approved and completed and their service after the mortgage was done has been phenomenal, just perfect. I liked everything about the process, I dealt with one person throughout the process and, at closing, I was told that with Quicken there were about 150 pages instead of the usual 250 or more - very clean, neat, easy process.",5
Allen,"Owensboro, KY","Reviewed June 1, 2019",It's been good. I'm still with them and I'm happy about it. They have great customer service and I wouldn't leave them. I been with them going on 9 years now. I would recommend this company to people. The process was fairly decent to me. Not much of a complaint and I wasn't really in a rush to breeze through. People I talked to seemed believable and transparent and that's something I like a lot.,5
Jason,"Jefferson, SC","Reviewed June 1, 2019","My experience, on the whole, has been great. Their application process is fully online which is very convenient. They do a great job of keeping you up to date during the whole process & just give the impression of a modern & innovative company. I love that it doesn't force you to deal with people unless totally necessary. If you don't have good credit that's probably a bad thing but for me it made the whole experience very convenient & fast. I liked how automated most of it was, how fast the process was & that I could do it all online. They staff when I've had to deal with them were friendly & seemed very knowledgeable. If you're the type of person that likes to deal with people then Quicken Loans is probably not for you. If you don't have good credit then you should probably look elsewhere. They seem to make decisions based on hard numbers & little else.",5
Alexa,"Plymouth, WI","Reviewed June 1, 2019","I had a good experience with Quicken Loans. From the start they made the lending experience easy and intuitive, and their customer service is amazing! Quicken Loans is very helpful and customer-focused. They really bend over backwards to make every customer's experience easy and pain free. Their customer service representatives are also very friendly and helpful! I like their website. It makes it easy for me to find information and answers to any questions I have about the process or their products. Every part of this experience has been easy and customized to my needs. If you are considering using Quicken Loans, don't hesitate!",5
Taylor,"Revere, MA","Reviewed June 1, 2019","First of all the agent the we contacted him via phone. Explained our financial base and what we want for a home price. He was very great. He helped. Gave us a competitive rate to buy. We signed all the papers and paid upfront 10% of the house price and it was all great and super easy. Best process I was been through taking a loan ever! Fast and quick response about eveything, good customer service, great paying option and a convenient while using their service a lot. They are amazing. Just wonderful!!! Called me in 1 day after applying and reviewing my account. They were super super helpful with everything and I suggest doing it online to save up time from talking over the phone or in person. But they were pretty asking a lot of question about my financial history which in time become kind of annoying but it's not a big deal at all.",5
Robert,"Bristol, CT","Reviewed June 1, 2019","My experience with Quicken Loans has been positive and known them to be fair about the loans I receive from them. I obtained my mortgage through Quicken Loans. I love the design from the website, how easy it is to find a loan, and how easy it was to obtain a loan. These factors were what made me decide to go through Quicken Loans. I liked how they asked me about my demographics. I didn't like how I was sent through the ringer with all of these ads. I felt the ads were a distraction and made slightly aggravated. But I didn't like how many loan providers do not sign up for Quicken Loans. This makes me feel frustrated when looking for a lower price loan or mortgage. I felt the companies did not want to look at my credit history and simply based their decision on my demographics.",5
Edward,"Montgomery, AL","Reviewed June 1, 2019","It has been pretty good to me and my home for the time I have had it. I have not had any problems so far. The price is also pretty good, at in my opinion and the service is top-tier. The service is really good, probably the best company I have worked at this point. To put it shortly it's pretty quick and simple so I can't complain. They definitely have the best customer service out of most home mortgage companies.",5
Zelda,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed June 1, 2019","I started the process of getting the loan. In the middle of it, I got sick and of course, I couldn't call back. When I got better, they closed the process, and I got left hanging. The people there were very nice except for the one that told me the file was closed. He refused to do anything and was rude. As a way afterthought I should have called back and talked to someone else.",2
Michael,"Bronx, NY","Reviewed May 31, 2019","They were very trusted and reliable, value their customers, easy to do business with cause they have a good website and app. They charge very reasonably, don't put a lot of pressure, employees are well behaved, don't have to wait to long for granting a loan. They didn't charge a high fee to start business with them. It was easy to recycle and getting a cash advance very convincing. The additional fee was not too much. Didn't have to wait to long for the response makes Quicken Loans very effective.",4
Michelle,"Dawson, MN","Reviewed May 31, 2019","I could answer all the questions online from home. It was an easy process that took some of the stress of getting a mortgage. I could do this online from home, eliminating the anxiety of going to a bank. It was very convenient. A bit impersonal but that is one of the main reasons I like it. The website has you answer questions about income and assets and gives choices as to where you can get a loan, with choices of terms like APR and length of loan. I had choices to choose from so that I could find what was right for me.",4
Jancie,"Smithville, MI","Reviewed May 31, 2019","When using Quicken Loans, the first thing I noticed was that their website was extremely informative and had everything I needed to learn and get in touch an agent when ready. They were very kind. I did not feel intimidated by their process. Their process is very first time home buyer friendly. My experience with Quicken Loans has been a very personal experience and one I will never forget. They were my first stop on my way to obtaining a mortgage. I got a quote from them when I first started shopping for mortgages. They were very professional and courteous, and walked me through the whole experience.",4
Mary,"Boerne, TX","Reviewed May 31, 2019","It was fast and easy, good service, plenty of help from them, everything worked out and was well done. My loan was quickly taken care and had no problems. Because of this it helps decrease my need for loans and have hardly any debts. Replies for this have been constant and the customer service has been great. Would recommend this to be to help with loans. But my payment was increased about a month after. Didn't not like this because they forced me to do online banking. I applied to Quicken Loan with not very high an expectation in the first place. Did take a while to get contacted. Was then applying to put all my information down. Took a while to have a letter sent in the mailbox.",3
Marie,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed May 31, 2019","Quicken's a amazing company - fast, very easy, super simple and straightforward process. Doesn't take long at all to get approved.

Just have to upload certain documents and if you need support they are always available to give support and help whether it be by the support email by phone or by live chat. They're very professional, super friendly and very nice to do business with. They're fun to work with. I have had a easy time dealing with their company by phone, website or email or mobile app.",5
Nikki,"Compton, IL","Reviewed May 31, 2019","It was a learning experience. I liked that there was a lot of information as we had no previous experience dealing with mortgages or mortgage companies. We were able to make a more informed decision to not use Quicken Loans but rather a local mortgage company. We disliked not having someone local that we could call and ask questions. It was all online, something that we did not fully trust.",3
Kelly,"Indianapolis, IN","Reviewed May 31, 2019",My experience with Quicken Loans has been honestly not too bad. Sometimes I get the quick loans that I'm needing and sometimes I don't. It's really all a gamble but I give them good ratings. I have liked the way that Quicken Loans has been really fast about getting me the loans that I honestly need and think no other about it. They have honestly sat and listened to why I needed that exact loan and they have in fact never looked against it and honestly helped me during the hard times I really had struggles. ,5
Daniel,"Adelanto, CA","Reviewed May 31, 2019","The process of getting the loan was grueling. I hated every moment of it. I had never signed my name so many times that for a while I didn't wanna see it anymore and the wait, 3 months before I moved into my home so not a good one.",3
Areli,"Bakersfield, CA","Reviewed May 31, 2019",My experience with them was very comforting since they did all they could to approve me since my credit is not the greatest. I believe they are a great company for many reasons since they have the lowest rates and amiable customer service. They by far have exceeded my expectations. Courtesy and precision they are above all other companies I have dealt with.,3
James,"Dyersburg, TN","Reviewed May 31, 2019","The process took a little time, we needed to have all the proper paperwork and time to get everything process, after we everything got process and approved, we felt great and were better off financially. We liked their customer service and how closely they worked with us. You felt more like a customer instead of just an account number. One of the thing I liked was their work ethic, they treated very nicely and was able to answer any questions we might have about the loan. But disliked the time to get a loan and the amount of paperwork to fill out, other than that we were very pleased with our interaction with Quicken Loans. Quicken Loans has been a great company to do business with over the years. They have great rates which are very reasonable, excellent customer service and would recommend them to anyone.",5

Then after submitting the required documents, I was given the rate requested and approved for the mortgage. The application process was very easy. The things that I have liked have been the excellent customer service and fast process throughout the process. They are always available to answer questions when needed. Submitting necessary paperwork is easy and fast without much confusion. The only part of the process that I didn't like was having to submit so much personal information online due to data safety. I am always cautious of giving out my personal information for fear of breach and identity theft.",4
Jesse,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed May 31, 2019",They had a nice website and walkthrough. I was not afraid of starting the loans because it was explained in a good amount. There were just some questionable things I did not question as I should have. I disliked the interest rates and the locations. Quicken Loans seemed a bit unprofessional. The interest rates seemed to keep going up no matter how much I paid. But Quicken Loans did a good job contacting me and not contacting me too much. Some other loans would contact over and over again like some loan shark back in the day. I am no longer with Quicken Loans because the interest rates were crazy. They did work well with making sure I knew when to pay. I am now with Bank of America with my loans.,3

Mia,"San Pablo, CA","Reviewed May 31, 2019",Quicken Loans was a very reliable service that made financing my home an easier process. They really made sure to work with me on a very personal level to help me based on my financial needs. The process of getting a mortgage with Quicken Loans was made really simple for me. They were well-organized and helpful in providing all the information I needed. I had one banker that helped me throughout the entire process of receiving a loan and that felt like well-respected personal service that gave me a sense of security. But sometimes it was hard to reach the banker by phone when I needed them. Overall my experience with Quicken Loans was positive.,4
Jennifer,"Green Bay, WI","Reviewed May 31, 2019",It has been so easy from the start of the process to the closing on the house. We were approved very quickly and everything was explained to us in a way that was easy to understand. We were not sure about it at first but as we were going through the process it was easy to complete each and every step securely. I like that we were able to input all of our information quickly and easily in a secure database. We found out right away if we were approved or denied and it was not overly complicated like other companies were when we contacted them.,5
Patrick,"Ridgeland, MS","Reviewed May 31, 2019",My experience with Quicken Loans have been good. They have good rates making for good loan terms with a good time frame as well. Their rates could be better. They're not bad but they could be better. My process with them started online on my computer. I filled out a application there and then it approved me online. The process is much easier because most of it is done online. You don't have to do too much else offline to get your loan. Overall they are good. They are not the best but they are up there.,4

Janet,"Miami, FL","Reviewed May 31, 2019",I had a pretty good experience with them. Someone from the company was available by phone daily. I am the type of person who asks a lot of questions so that worked out well for me. Quicken Loans made the process easy. With the help they offered walking me thru getting all my paperwork together on we could make it to closing without any complications. The only thing I disliked about doing business with Quicken Loans was the mistake made at our closing of my refinance was the fact that the person that did the closing docs was negligent in going over everything and made error in the amount of funds that would cover my escrow for the year of my loan. This error caused me a hardship when I had to come out of my pocket to cover this mistake at the time to pay my taxes and home owners insurance.,3
Dennis,"Valley Center, CA","Reviewed May 30, 2019","After nearly 3 weeks into the re-fi process, I was given final re-fi costs (closing and lender's fees) that were not even close to the original quotes (300%+ increase).

Davi,"Lincoln, NE","Reviewed May 30, 2019","Fees could have been less and interest rate could have been lower I suppose, but it was in line with the market. It was still very competitive and reasonable. It was quick and easy and not very difficult to apply and run the loan.

Allyce,"Cape Coral, FL","Reviewed May 30, 2019",It didn't work as well as I would have liked. It took longer to hear back from them than expected and ultimately I ended up not using them. I was quite disappointed. I thought my information got lost in the shuffle. The thing I liked most about using Quicken Loans was that it was done all online. I did not need to fill out any pesky paperwork or talk to an annoying salesman on the phone.,2
Thomas,"Orland Park, IL","Reviewed May 30, 2019",The process of signing up online was very easy as it took me step by step and listed my choices on loans and my loans payments based upon what I would want to chose. I liked everything about it to the easy signup and the tracking options you can do to get on time with your payments. The tracking options that are provided go from emails to tracking on your phone. I knew when they wanted their money back and so I paid them back. I enjoyed everything from this loan company. They have been pretty good.,4

All the paperwork was a headache and the waiting for approval. Now it is faster and better with technology.",3
Bryan,"San Francisco, CA","Reviewed May 30, 2019","It has been been very smooth and easy from the start since I got the loan online. I like that there was very little human interaction, it was refreshing to complete everything I needed at home. It felt great completing everything online. If I needed to find information it was easy to look for it since all of my documents are already at home. I wished Quicken Loans gave me a quote faster just based on my income and credit score so that I could already see how much I qualify for. The process was very easy and a step by step process. It felt like Quicken loans would treat more fairly since I'm ** compared to some of the larger banks.",5
Myla,"Brooklyn, NY","Reviewed May 30, 2019",Quicken's loans are very helpful and very nice individuals. Their website and the app is very fluid and user-friendly.

Trenton,"Stevensville, MI","Reviewed May 30, 2019",Quicken Loans makes me feel like a valued customer. They were able to treat me like a person and not just another number like some of the other bigger banks. Other places wouldn't take care of me. I like the way they take an interest in you and show care and concern about you and your property. I liked the way they were able to give me such a good rate. Also I worked with a certain person every time. It was a simple process first off started with checking online. After going online I figured out a few things then decided to call for more assistance. After calling they took care of me and made everything super simple! They made sure everything was done right. But there was delay in getting back with me a few times.

I was expecting a more drawn out and long process, but it was surprisingly easy and quick to navigate a mortgage with them. I liked that the process was fairly straightforward and easy to comprehend, and that there were also guides to help understand the more complex notions of having a mortgage. Some of my extended family members claimed to have ""horror stories"" with them, but I found the mortgage process to be surprisingly smooth. They pretty much did what they promised to do, and helped me set up a mortgage for my home.",4
Jeff,"Roswell, GA","Reviewed May 30, 2019","When I was getting my mortgage I walked in and talked to a representative who was the friendliest person I have ever met, after a long wait time. Then we talked and worked things out for about an hour and then we were done. It is a pretty good experience because we have a very affordable monthly rate on a beautiful house. Also they have great customer service and I have never had a problem with them plus they offer effortless ways to pay. I like the friendliness of the people who work there, and the relatively low but reasonable rates. Also they have a lot of locations so the one I went to was only a few minutes away from my apartment. One of the things I disliked about my experience with Quicken Loans is the long wait time. I took 35 minutes for me to just talk to a representative when I was trying to get a mortgage.",4
Andre,"Saint Louis, MO","Reviewed May 30, 2019","It was one of the best services I have ever encountered. I liked that it was fast, easy and smooth.

Tim,"Desoto, TX","Reviewed May 30, 2019","It was a very good experience. They were quick to answer any questions. And we had no issues during the closing process. They had excellent customer service. It was easy to find information of the type of loans they offer. My experience was easy and fast. From the time I applied online, I got a call from Brandon and right there, he was in my corner. He was not pushy or did I feel like a number. Of course his job to get paid; what's wrong with that? However, he was not overbearing or anything. He explained to me the process and from there, it was just a matter of getting pre-qualified. When I put my cell phone number on the Quicken initial application I started receiving robocalls about mortgages and they have been constant since then. Either Quicken is participating in the robocall scam or they have been compromised themselves.",4
Jeff,"Forest Hills, NY","Reviewed May 30, 2019",My experience was very quick and easy. Was able to qualify. Very responsive quickly and without problems. Staff was professional and easy to work with. Liked the easy online application. Liked the process as well the entire procedure as well as the quick turnaround when it came to approval. Found the entire process very good. You need to go online and fill out all the required questions and upload required documents. Company then quickly got back with an offer that was competitive. My one concern that all my information was online and susceptible to hacking or being found out over internet.,4
Sheldon,"Washington Court House, OH","Reviewed May 30, 2019",It is who I have my current mortgage through. It was the most simplified process from start to finish that I have ever experienced. I started my application online and followed the process each step on their app. The whole process from start to finish took just less than one week. It was by far the easiest mortgage process that I had ever experienced. I found nothing along the process that I disliked. They are a great company. They have the most competitive rates and get you approved quicker than any place I have ever dealt with. I would highly recommend them to anybody. I like how from the time you apply they keep you up to date on the process and don't just leave you in the dark. The way they treat their customers is second to none.,4
Judy,"Greeneville, TN","Reviewed May 30, 2019","I researched Quicken Loans online and then subsequently called their 1-800 line. They answered all of my questions fully and I gave them the information they needed and subsequently received loan approval. Good and easy to do business from the start. The company is fair and equitable in its business practices. Its people are courteous, knowledgeable and cheerful during the entire loan process. It was timely process that was well received. They answer any questions in a forthcoming manner. Although I was initially filled with dread before calling, I did not particularly relish all of the paperwork during the loan process; however, it seemed to be a necessary evil.",3
John,"Franklin, IN","Reviewed May 30, 2019",The price was great and the features are easy to use. The features are quite easy to understand and use when you are taking out a mortgage for the first time. There needs to be a live chat option so that you can talk to someone over the phone about issues that may come up sooner or later. There are people who you can call at anytime if you are having issues with your bill and why it may have increased or decreased in the coming months. The features of the service are great. It helped me be able to pay off my mortgage on time when I would receive the bill in the mail. The features were easy to go over on how much you owe each month. The price could be better in my opinion because most people don't want their mortgage rates to increase each year and have to pay a different price from what they may have paid before the price change in their mortgage plan.,5
Bob,"Muskegon, MI","Reviewed May 30, 2019","I had a long-term mortgage with Quicken Loans which covered my home costs and other expenses.

I approached the mortgage company with my detailed assessment of my needs, wants, desires, and budget analysis, which was a tedious process in itself, then was directed to as very helpful mortgage claims person. I greatly enjoyed the professionalism and excellent services provided throughout the loan process and was highly impressed by the reasonable mortgage rates and affordability. There was nothing particularly annoying or troublesome, but the process was extremely complex and I was grateful that the loan experts were able to assist me throughout.",5

Robert,"Mc Donald, PA","Reviewed May 29, 2019","This is related to applying for a VA loan. I am self-employed but recently got a job in which I have W-2s. They received all of the information and gave a pre-approval. My business income was more than sufficient to cover the costs of the loan and over and above that income was the income for my w-2s. I uploaded all of the information and faxed the remaining info. One week before closing they called to say that the income was not enough and cancelled the loan. It was absolutely ridiculous the way it was handled. I paid for pest inspections, appraisals, and water quality test; close to a thousand dollars in costs, based on the pre-approval. Nothing changed in the information from the pre-approval stage, they just cancelled and refused to refund the costs. It was an absolutely awful experience.",1

Adam,"Richmond, VA","Reviewed May 29, 2019",I've really enjoyed working with Quicken Loans. Their agents are very responsive and empowered to actually solve issues I may have. I've never had any serious issues with them and would definitely recommend them.. I like how simple it is to understand what I'm paying. The process in getting the loan was hassle free and very quick. I would recommend them to anyone that likes to limit human contact when signing up for services. I did ninety five percent online. I could not believe how quick and simple it was! The website is easy to navigate and you can call to get help if need be.,5
Michael,"Corona, CA","Reviewed May 29, 2019","I just looked online and read everything I could before I tried and went with them after a lot of study.

After you explain your situation and get the best options for yourself, the process that follows is very fast and thorough. I couldn't have been pleased more. The Customer service kept me up to date on the progress and it all completed and done in a short time. Disliked maybe the length of the title search, but I do understand that it does take a minimum of 2 weeks. The whole process was simple and the information I provided was processed quickly. I was surprised but satisfied. All in all, it was a great and unexpected experience.",4
Brandon,"Brookhaven, PA","Reviewed May 29, 2019","Quicken Loans provided me with in-depth information on how they work their mortgage payments. They are always consistent with what they told me when I originally got a mortgage with them. Their company payment arrangement is simple and easy to understand. I like how Quicken Loans lays out the different factors that contribute to the mortgage payment that I pay each month. I also like how they give me a monthly breakdown of how much I would have left on the mortgage by the end of the year. But I would like an easier way to check how much is on my mortgage, since I usually will pay extra to try to cut down the amount of time that it left on paying off my mortgage. I think having a website that would allow me to check my mortgage balance would be very suitable for this.",4

The application process was easy and simple and at the time, the loan fit perfectly with what we needed. And we were helped every step of the way.

I would recommend this to someone who doesn't have a local bank they can deal with to try to find and obtain a mortgage.",4
Neil,"Covina, CA","Reviewed May 29, 2019",They were very nice and easy to work with. They made sure we understood everything and worked with us. This was a few years ago but I am sure they are still a great company. They explained anything that was in my questions when working with them. They were very informative with the process.

I really appreciated the fact that they tried to help me lower my costs and provided me with the simplest options. I also liked the fact that they were really quick at responding. But I disliked how they had so many customers ahead of me. I had to wait quite a bit until my turn came but that's okay. I wish they could have been more approachable.,3

I started by calling and talking with a mortgage banker. We then discussed my needs and looked into my credit score and finances. We discussed loan options and rates based on my details.

Charlandria,"Pleasant Grove, AL","Reviewed May 28, 2019",I think they were a great company that worked hard to make sure I had good rates and the loan I needed. Our representative was very nice and always helped us with the steps to submit our application. I liked that I was always kept up to date on what was happening with my loan application and that the customer service representative was always very respectable. But we would have done things differently like when I asked about an update on things at one point but the original rep I had was no longer there and the new rep hadn't contacted us to let us know they would be handling our file. I liked that it was easy to submit and not have to jump through too many hoops because our information was already on file and our representative was able to do most of what we needed beforehand.,4
Charles,"Norristown, PA","Reviewed May 28, 2019",The process was quick and easy and kept me updated every step of the way.

I really enjoyed the customer service and how they answered all of my questions and concerns within a timely manner. They made me feel safe and secure and provided me with the information I needed along the way. I had very minimal issues with Quicken Loans and would only consider for a faster process of getting my statement sent out in a more timely fashion. The mortgage rate also feels a little higher than other competitors.,4

I love the fact that they will do the vast majority of the work and give you a great rating in the end. It really helps for first time buyers. I love how fast it was plus how they did everything and explained it all to me. There was no scheming, no coning. Plus the price was affordable for me to pay and save money at the same time. But they don't inform you when your price has risen or fallen. You have to contact them for that. The payment choices are plain. I like to use PayPal for security reasons. But they don't seem to have much security.",5

You can pay the minimum and go back to it whenever you are able to pay for it. One thing that I like about this company is that I can pay my loan at anytime and they don't give you an extra fee when you pay. It is pretty nice to have. I'm satisfied overall with the company since I've been with them for a while and they haven't given me any problems. The process is quite simple. You can sign up with the company when you call their phone number and they will ask how much you want in loan and they will give it to you. You can pay overtime so you don't have to worry about paying the whole amount immediately.,4

Everything went just how I expected it and was easy to pay off and deal with and it was easy to understand the terms. I had heard good things about Quicken and they were all true. I would use it again if I was in need of another. I have already told other if they needed a mortgage this is one of the best ways to get one.,5
Julian,"Federal Way, WA","Reviewed May 27, 2019","They were sometimes pushy. They were sometimes nice. They were sometimes okay with me being poor but they were most of the time kind of neutral and wanted my business. My API is a large portion of my income and I wanted it to be a smaller amount. They were sometimes okay with me pointing this out but I don't know for sure. I said to the men there, ""How can I do this better? How can I do this okay? How can I do this in a way that I want to do this but don't go too much where I can't pay? How can I do this sirs? How can I do this maams?"" I really want to get a loan and do something to help my future, and they said, ""Okay sign this paper work,"" and do a cool thing and I really want to show that I am a trust person.",4
Michael,"Seekonk, MA","Reviewed May 27, 2019",My experience with Quicken Loans has been very beneficial to me and my family. The process of obtaining a mortgage was easier than I thought; in less than sixty days I closed on the house. They took the time to go over all the steps necessary for me to complete the application process without any hassles or mistakes. They also followed up after the closing to make sure I was happy with the mortgage. There was nothing that I disliked about the process; besides all the paperwork you have to fill out and sign. They make the process of obtaining a mortgage about as easy as it could be for the home buyer. I liked that I could start the majority of the mortgage process on the internet and over the phone; there ended up being little human interaction in the process; other than the closing paperwork.,5

The service from Quicken Loans is far beyond World Class and I'm very pleased with them. I will certainly use them again for my future needs. The main thing that I liked is the customer service that I got from Quicken Loans because they really made me feel like a valued customer and they also made me feel like they were going above and beyond what other similar companies would do. The process was very easy due to the fact that they only asked for important information and nothing more. They only asked for it once and once the approval process was complete, the amount of time taken to get me the funding was within three days which was a pleasant experience.",5
Melli,"Canton, OH","Reviewed May 27, 2019","I've looked on their website first to gather a few information on my own before calling one of their staff member and from there it was very good. We set up a meeting and we organized the application, filled it up and waited barely a day to have the final decision. I have liked the efficacy and knowledge of their staff, always polite, friendly and very helpful. I liked how easy the whole process was from the application, to being approved and to move into our new home. Everything went smooth and was enjoyable. Overall the process was simple. Throughout my time with them, I have had nothing but positive things to say about them. I would recommend them.",4
Christopher,"Trenton, NJ","Reviewed May 27, 2019","My experience was great. Once I got approved everything went smoothly during the process. Up until Quicken Loans I never experienced a company where they had the customer service like Quicken Loans. The main thing I liked about Quicken Loans was the customer service and how smoothly the process moved along. They were the only company to have the process of getting a loan go smooth. Also, the main thing about the whole process that I liked was the understanding that the reps had there. When I got approved the reps even came to my house and congratulated me. The only thing that I didn't like was the process took a little bit of time, but that's the only thing I don't like about it. The main problem I see from other people is the same thing and it takes so long for other people to get money.",5

They provide an excellent service and always quickly respond whenever I have questions. Quicken Loans has really good interest rates. I really like their website. The website is easy to navigate and all the information you need is easy to find on the website. For the process first, you go to the website. You put in all of the pertinent information and then you are matched with banks that are willing to give you a loan based upon your information. If you do not like what you see you do not have to engage with the bank any further.",5

They have helped me out every step of the way when i needed them. In my opinion it was very simple getting started with them.

I was pleased with my results and would recommend to everyone. They lived up to their word and company mantra. It is not every day that you can depend a large company to do what it actually advertises it will do. I liked the speed of the application process and the time it took to receive the loan. It was extremely quicker than other companies that I have used before. I liked that I had many ways to apply and be approved or denied instead of forever for an agent to get back to you with your results. It was timely and all of my question were personally answered whenever any arose. They were very helpful and understanding. Your best bet if applying would be to apply online. It is faster and easier, you can also compare between companies.",5

I liked how friendly the employees were when I was visiting to the place. I also liked how fast it was to get the mortgage filed which left me with more time to continue with my errands. I only disliked that it seemed like a tough process at first. Also the drive over there was almost 30 minutes, but that's my own problem.",5
Kelly,"Appleton, WI","Reviewed May 27, 2019",We applied with very little money down for our first home. Rates were good and loan was fast and easy to apply for and to be approved. The information they asked for was easy to supply and loan was approved faster than we thought it would be. We applied online and within minutes were approved so we were able to submit our offer knowing we could actually afford our first home. We had very little knowledge about buying a home and they helped guide us thru the steps from start to finish always ready to answer a question or explain anything we needed to know. We had good luck with them until we built a larger home and they could not offer us the same low loan rate as our bank was able to. They have a limit on how much they will lend. Even though going thru the bank was a cheaper rate it was a much longer process to get our second home loan than our first loan was.,5
Deborah,"Woodbury, TN","Reviewed May 26, 2019","Overall I have had a great experience with Quicken Loans because they have great customer service and are very helpful. After calling and trying to apply for a refinancing I was a lot of questions that I felt they would never end but I know it has to been done to get a loan that is right for me. In the end it was worth having a lower interest rate than I had previously. But after talking to them and stating that I will think about all of the information that I received, I was called by different people that wanted to go ahead and complete the loan. I do not like to be pressured. But Quicken Loans is willing to do what they can to get you the right loan and amount that is right for you. They also focused on me and was nice and friendly.",4

I searched for all the info I could and came across Quicken Loans. They have the best rates and service for me and my family's needs. They have been an amazing company to work with and are always there if I need anything or have any questions. I also have a personal mortgage broker on hand. I have always liked Quicken Loans for my mortgage needs. They are very helpful and also very good about explaining the details in full for me and my family. They are always working to keep me as a customer and keep coming back. In my experience with Quicken Loans I have only had a few problems along the way of doing business with them. The only thing I haven't really liked is sometimes the rates don't go down as much as I would like.,5

James,"Laurel, MD","Reviewed May 26, 2019",I have had nothing but positive experiences with Quicken Loans since I initiated contact with them. They treat you like you are one of the family more so than as a customer. They put things in terms that the average homeowner can understand without making you feel somewhat inadequate. What I have liked the most about my experience with Quicken Loans is the personalized service that I have received from start to finish. They also put things in terms that you can understand as a first time buyer. You don't feel like they are speaking down to you at any point and it feels like a collaborative effort.

Also, they didn't do a full appraisal which was great and saved money as well. I was able to save 250$ a month and kept the same terms just lower rate. The only thing I don't like is that the loan was sold to Wells Fargo and I had to refinance again with a bank that doesn't sell those loans because there was no way I wanted anything to do with Wells Fargo.",4

I obtained a mortgage with them but the interest rate was unsatisfactory, so I switched. Also, they raised my interest rate for no reason. I couldn't negotiate a lower rate so I had to switch. This was very cumbersome. I originally went with this company because of a recommendation from a friend. This was okay but I should have shopped around a bit more.

Quicken had no problem accepting me into their service and granted me the mortgage I needed on time. No rude follow up calls or any unwanted information. It was all solid, fluid, and I appreciated the demeanor of the people involved and the easy process overall. I like the advisors, the friendly and intuitive nature of the advisors, and the all around ease of access in use through desktop, mobile and phone.

You begin by calling or chatting with a Quicken Loans mortgage banker.

Before you close the loan, the company has to underwrite the mortgage that is, verify that your income and employment information is correct and make sure you have adequate homeowner's insurance. It also has to order a home appraisal from a third party. Quicken Loans are fast and efficient in what they do, and never cease to amaze me.

Everything was a pretty normal procedure, but faster than normal. It was very easy and fast to get the paperwork and get the ball rolling. Please be careful and do your research though since they will charge you a higher rate if you don't tell them what you expect to get.

I would choose them all over again but that right in this moment though. But if they have any good promotions going on, I could think about it.",5
Edwin,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed May 25, 2019","It was really simple and easy to get a loan from Quicken as the process is so much automated and there are best tools offered by the company to make the process even far more better and easier. It was really awesome as the interest rates were really low for me and also the experience was really good being with this company for such a long time. I liked the good behaviour by the staff and also the rate of interest offered by the company. It's faster and online so I can do my most of the work without any trouble. However, I didnt like the marketing and advertising process as sometimes I was getting a lot of calls which was not so good for me and my surroundings due to the bad services.",5
Kelly,"Milford, MA","Reviewed May 25, 2019",It was super easy. I applied online and got a quote the next day. They came up with a pay date and have stuck with it. They are a great company and make paying the loan back very easy and affordable. Absolutely fantastic experience. I would definitely use them again. I tell everyone I meet to apply for a loan through them.,5
Deb,"Tarpon Springs, FL","Reviewed May 25, 2019","It's been really good. I have read all the papers, had every question answered, things explained so I could understand and I feel satisfied with the process & the loan. I liked that they were very transparent about the whole process.",3
Tina,"Estacada, OR","Reviewed May 25, 2019",Quicken Loans did a great job. Great rates. I like their name of mortgage department Rocket Mortgage. It's a great name and shows you how quick you can get things going. The things I have liked about my experience is how fast they were in authorizing the loan. Other things that I liked about my experience is how they made the paperwork so you can understand it clearly and no hidden fees. But I wish the interest was a little lower. Another thing I disliked about my experience is I wish there were more ways to reach them quickly for any questions I may have had.,4
Alexus,"Miami, FL","Reviewed May 25, 2019","I was completely satisfied with Quicken Loans for the first several months of the process. Everything about my refinance was completely stress-free, thanks to my loan officer Delano. I was pre-approved, the agent was in touch once a week, and so forth. Then I found a co-op that I really liked well within my pre-approved value. I made an offer, it was accepted and I moved forward on the loan. I submitted everything that Quicken required and got a commitment letter. Every person I spoke with throughout the process were courteous, and very helpful! Everyone is so friendly and explains everything so you understand what is going on. Quicken Loans is a great company to deal with. Quicken Loans made the process of buying a new home simple. From friendly and helpful Loan Managers, to an user friendly website, made it easy and painless for my family. I would recommend this company to all my friends.",5

The way they do business is top of the line. They are so professional yet so laid back that they make you feel at home and part of the family. They are always there to help in every way. They communicate well, they explain everything well, and I really have no complaints about them.",5
Roman,"Long Beach, CA","Reviewed May 25, 2019","The process was lots of signing papers and stuff like that and went by fast for the most part, I mean we loved them. We came to them at first and for refinancing they actually came to us. The experience was great, they were pretty new when I first saw them but, they worked great for us and everyone at my house. I really loved how great of a loan they gave us and they were pretty up and coming but we paid back really fast. The thing that I have most liked is how fast they get back to us, we call them and they call us back within a couple of hours, it's great. We would definitely not be switching and we will be referring them to any new house seekers. One thing I have disliked is their facilities. These facilities are very dirty and they've gotten better in the past ten years, but they're no JP Morgan Chase.",5
Sharmila,"Birmingham, AL","Reviewed May 25, 2019",I have had a very wonderful experience. It was very easy to get the loan and the finance options were very favorable for me. They are very flexible and knowledgeable too. I really liked that it was easy to apply for and it was very quick to get a reply. They were no hidden surprises or indecisions on their part. It was very easy to understand everything that was going on. I like how quick it was to obtain a loan. Also I liked that I did not have to fill out a lot of information to see if I qualified or not to get the loan. But they could give you a comparison of what you would get from other companies.,5
Warren,"Reno, NV","Reviewed May 24, 2019","Total fraud. It starts off with a friendly person, who says I'm qualified for a mortgage at a certain amount. I find a house and agree to buy it. I spend some money doing the inspections, etc., to make sure it's solid. Then before I close on the house Quicken Loans has me pay their fee. The next day they say I'm not qualified for the loan, they don't ""feel"" my taxes are correct. Well, my taxes are just fine. They take another 2 1/2 weeks stringing me along before they say I'm not getting the loan. Not based on any Industry rules, regulations, or standards. Not even based on common Lender practices. They just feel they don't like my taxes.",1
Sheri,"Akron, OH","Reviewed May 24, 2019","My husband and I wanted to refinance our home to add me to the deed. We spoke to Jameson in the NE Ohio area and he said he understood our intentions and we were offered a VA loan due to my husband's military service. We were told that since he was receiving disability from the military we would not have to pay closing costs. That was a lie! Fast forward 18 months when we met with an estate planner and were told that I was not on the deed. I called Jameson and he was surprised by that. I called customer resolution and was told that Jameson reached out to them and he was unaware that they do not update deeds when refinancing. So, Jameson is uneducated with their processes. ",1
Pierce,"Baltimore, MD","Reviewed May 24, 2019","My experience was very good because Quicken Loans rates are very low and always looks out for their customers first before themselves and you can quality for a lot of loans from Quicken Loans because the interest rates are very low but very secure in the long run. They charge fewer fees and offer mobile payment options, you can get mortgage discounts and you can view your taxes online and your tax documents online. I liked that it was easy to get approved by name and credit score, the credentials and awards are appealing because of how so many customers in the past and their testimonies and how they are so much faster approval than other competitors. I was actually impressed with how fast and secure the service was because for an service to be newer and more secure and it's easy to view and track your home equity over time.

Daniel,"Springville, AL","Reviewed May 24, 2019",First of all I would recommend anyone attempting to get a loan for whatever reason to definitely consider Quicken Loans as their choice. My experience was simplified immediately by their loan personnel from the get go. The pure comfort of their professionalism was incredible. I felt the loan managers had genuine concern for me and that they really went out of their way to make me and my loan request to feel an important priority with them for the entire process. Not a week went by where I didn't hear from them during the initial process of attaining my first loan with them. Their representatives always made me feel valued and appreciated as a customer. ,5

Dana,"Arlington, TX","Reviewed May 24, 2019","There was a lot of paperwork, but I find that there always is during purchase and refinance of a home. They also offer competitive interest rates. Almost everything is done online with a little on the phone. I was able to complete the application online which was convenient for me. I prefer to complete everything online without having to interact with a person because that usually includes waiting on the phone or going to an office to meet with someone. My income verification was quicker than I expected. I received the loan without a problem, and the process went smoothly. I found the fee schedule to be very confusing and took time to figure out exactly what I would be required to pay. I would have preferred to have that information made clear in the beginning as most lenders do so I wouldn't have to spend so much time figuring it out.",3
Mike,"Kansas City, MO","Reviewed May 24, 2019",Quicken approved my loan faster than any bank. When the banks finally got back to me I had already closed on the house and was ready to start moving in. If I had needed to wait for the banks I would have lost out on the house and would have needed to start my search over again. Not only that but Quicken offered the loan with terms that were better than the banks.,5
Corey,"Metropolis, IL","Reviewed May 24, 2019",Easy to pay off the loan and mortgage. Great to work with. Nobody was rude to me over the phone as well.

The staff there was really nice and did a good job of making sure that I always felt like I was getting a good help. They were able to get me the help that I need. I did like how it was able to go fast with how things were in the process. The speed was something good for me since I was in a bit of a rush with things.

Tom,"Kansas City, MO","Reviewed May 24, 2019","Begin by calling or chatting with a Quicken Loans mortgage banker. The company uses your credit score and basic financial information to determine the loan options and rates for which you qualify. Everyone was easily accessible for any questions I had. Made the process of buying a home so much easier than I thought it would be. It was outstanding, friendly, communicative and seamless. Had the fund to the bank before deal was even closed. Highly recommended. Very little chance of disappointment. The company is able to pull pay stubs and bank statements directly from their financial institutions, eliminating the need to scrounge up those documents and send them over. This lender does not offer construction loans or home equity financing though.",5

Katelynn,"Pottsville, PA","Reviewed May 24, 2019",My experience with Quicken Loans has been overall pretty positive. I was confused about the process and terms and conditions at first. They explained it thoroughly and are always very pleasant when I ask them any questions. I like their quick problem solving skills. Also I love that they have discounts on payments for loyal customers. They are very customer oriented and I think that is super important. First they check my credit score and if I qualify for a loan then they verify my income. They use your income amount to determine the best loan amount for you. I love that the process was not difficult. But I disliked that if we put both my husband and me on the loan that we didn't qualify. We only qualified when I applied with just my name. My husband has a low credit score but a bigger income than me but they disqualified him.,5
Jason,"Parkville, MD","Reviewed May 24, 2019","They were easy to sign up with and get the ball rolling, no hassle like we have heard other companies can be and they also have good rates.

We should be able to pay things off in the time period we have set. I like that they are a high quality brand and easy to work with. They have someone there to answer question for you at all times if you have any and are make sense with their answers. It's a shame that more people do not use them and that they took so long to come along and compete with the other companies.",4

They used my credit card to choose the best rate for me. After this they underwrote the mortgage to make sure everything was correct. I really liked how I did not have to receive a lot of annoying emails in my inbox. The rates were very easy to work with as well. One problem that I faced, however, was that our loans got bounced around from place to place. It was a bit of a hassle for us but we found a way to work around it because of good communication that we had with the staff. I would definitely recommend them to others as they were kind and super helpful to my family and I.",5

I liked that process was simple and hassle free and not overly complicated like with some other providers in the market. I closed out in three weeks which is pretty good in my book. The only thing that could have improved it a little bit further in my opinion would definitely have been a better website and mobile experience.,4

I liked the ability to contact them at any time through various means and get a prompt response. I was doubtful about using an internal insurer, but my expectations have been surpassed greatly.

I was able to complete the majority of the process from the comfort of my home, the website is easy to use. Quicken loans uses the most up to date technology to streamline the mortgage process, only one meeting in person was needed. Payments are easy to make even on a phone. The Quicken Loans rep could have been more proactive after we signed up for the mortgage, ie contacting me about newer products or services or helping me refinance. But Quicken Loans customer support is very helpful. If you miss a payment they do not charge you with unnecessary penalties and understand things happen now and then.",4

It was a good experience and I would recommend them to all my friends and family if they asked my opinion on them. It was nice being able to do the whole process online rather than have to find a place to go to in person and go there and do everything from a location. It’s much easier to do so online and it’s faster. But I would like to see a web chat feature like a Skype section to be able to make sure the information that I am inputting is the right information that they need to complete the process. It would also speed up the information gathering process and save me from worrying if the information I am entering is exactly the information that they want and need to have to complete the application process.,5

It was so simple that I think anyone could do it in minutes. If you know how to use a computer, you can use Quicken. It's that simple. There were no hiccups through the whole process at all.

I didn't like how I had to gather a bunch of information that I would have rather had them do for me. I would like more customization throughout the process and not just everyone is the same.

I think the experience is fairly effective but pretty impersonal. I was able to handle the process largely on my own.

The promises made by the customer service representative regarding closing costs, appraisals and closing dates were hollow. With closing costs doubling on our last loan estimate from the original, to not getting a ""preferred customer"" closing discount, to having to pay for an appraisal that really does not need to be done (we have a minimum of $600K of equity in our home) is ridiculous. I would start the process with another lender, but am worried our credit rating now will take a hit by starting over.",2
Aji,"Hattiesburg, MS","Reviewed May 22, 2019","Felt good doing business with the best company for that particular profession. Love the great professionalism and the many knowledgeable staff and workers. Like and respect this company a lot, and really believe in their practices and company policies a lot. However, I do like to be contacted more through email and text than by calls. I prefer to have all my physical mail more electronic, email is more speedy and convenient to me.",4
Gary,"Bronx, NY","Reviewed May 22, 2019","It's been satisfactory so far. I liked the terms they offered me and I haven't had any problems with any payments thus far. I think the mortgage I received with Quicken Loans is the best deal I could get out there. I liked the fact that since I was a first-time buyer, it was a bit easier for me to get a mortgage at a fairly low rate. I also always have the option to easily refinance my mortgage if necessary. They made the process easy for me. I always feel like they are there to help if I run into any snags and I don't feel like they tried to take advantage of me. First, I used the mortgage calculator to get a good image of what kind of terms I could expect. I then contacted an agent online, received a quote and made a deal from there. It didn't take long before I was approved.",5
Mark,"Manhattan, KS","Reviewed May 22, 2019","The customer service of Quicken Loans is great, they answered each question I had no matter what, is so fast and efficient.

Ronald,"Allentown, NY","Reviewed May 22, 2019","They show a lot of great services, especially with the monthly tax, and also with the web and email information, also when I bought the house they told me all the info I needed to buy it at the best price. Getting the mortgage is simple. You saw the houses, after a representator can make an initial offer and also you define the current mortgage. I liked it their web page, cause they include a lot of information about the taxes, and the rates of the houses, and their phone attention is amazing, and also like it the offers. But when I use their official telephone net is a little with delay.",3

Cindy,"Saint George, UT","Reviewed May 22, 2019",Our experience was great. They were very professional about everything. We got approved very quickly and was able to pay off this home with no penalties. Any time we had to call them they always had very respective friendly people. The whole process was so easy. We were approved in no time at all. I just filled out paperwork on line and did the application and was approved immediately. They told me what I qualified for. The amount of the loan. Our realtor told us about Quicken Loans and it was so quick. I couldn't believe how fast and easy it was.,5

I also liked how nice the people were to deal with and how nice their website is. ,4
Monique,"El Centro, CA","Reviewed May 22, 2019",My experience with having a mortgage with Quicken Loans is an average experience. I liked that it was easy to get approved for the mortgage with Quicken Loans and the application process for the mortgage wasn't as complicated as other companies. The process of getting a mortgage with Quicken Loans is filling out an application and waiting for approval. But I disliked that the mortgage application with Quicken Loans process was longer than expected. I wish it took less time so the process could be smoother.,3
Chris,"Delavan, WI","Reviewed May 22, 2019",It was a decent experience. I don't like the process typically but it was not bad at all and the people were pretty decent as well.

I like things that are like me.",4
Greg,"Montello, WI","Reviewed May 22, 2019","I at one point had a small house mortgage through Quicken. Best part was easy application and fast processing. I liked that Quicken's application process was very simple. I remember having to prove certain things and getting checks done and filling out paperwork, but the overall time spent felt appropriate and more like building toward something great. We felt confident in the quick approval in our own ability to make it happen. I liked that they were reputable and more of a consumer brand than a bank. I would do business again if the interest rates were just slightly lower. They did not have the absolute best interest rates at the time I got a loan through them. They are a bit old school in some of their banking software.",4
Joyann,"Allentown, PA","Reviewed May 22, 2019","The process of getting a mortgage with Quicken Loans was less stressful and hectic than I could ever have imagined. They walked me through the process step by step and offered any additional assistance along the way. My mortgage experience with Quicken Loans has been a very good one. They are available when I need them with hours that are convenient and meet my schedule needs. They offer excellent customer service and very affordable rates. They truly care about my business and value me as a customer. They make it easy to find answers to my questions and navigate their website. They have exceeded my expectations and then some. They are very knowledgeable and friendly. They are not just a mortgage company, they are more like a caring family member or friend who is always looking out for your best interests.",5
Vijay,"Saint Paul, MN","Reviewed May 22, 2019","I was searching online for better mortgage rate and contacted the customer support and from there I have provided all the documentation and started the loan process. They are very good partners in the home loan search process. Great way to compare and get a better loan rate in competition with regular mortgage lenders and their customer service is exceptional and very helpful and I really liked the process. However, they should not resell the loans once they originate. It creates lot of confusion if the loan is resold.",5
Shannon,"Kingman, AZ","Reviewed May 22, 2019","The experience has been very good. I was so happy with everything. I wasn't knowledgeable about the terms and they helped a lot. I liked our agent. She helped me a lot with my first time buying a home. They were available at all hours to answer. It was way easier than I thought. They got me a good loan and fixed interest rates. I liked the fee and rates. And I liked the amount of the loan. However, I didn't like dealing with multiple people. I didn't like the email aspect, didn't like how much paperwork we had to do. And I didn't like all the phone calls. But they are quick and easy to do business with.",5
Dana,"Morgantown, WV","Reviewed May 22, 2019",I like having a loan with Quicken. They are a lot better than other lenders that I have worked with in the past. My agent took care of all of the processes. I did not have to do anything but sign the forms. It was a really easy process and I could not be happier. It was great and I had no problems at all. They are just a great company to work with. Their terms and easy to understand and there are not any hidden fees and anything like that that a lot of companies do.,4
Lisa,"Monticello, AR","Reviewed May 22, 2019","At the time that I accessed the site and started the process of refinancing the loan that I had with another finance institution, I filled out my information and waited to hear back and that was the gist of the entire process.

Jonathan,"King, NC","Reviewed May 22, 2019",We liked most of our experience with them. The application with them was very simple and they helped us get a great deal on our mortgage. The customer service was very good and they helped us get on the right track. Most of the people that we worked with were very eager and willing to help us. Also the website was easy to navigate and we were able to find what we were looking for. The process was not too long. The best advice that I can give is to be organized and give them everything they need to make the process easy on you and them.,5
Mark,"El Paso, TX","Reviewed May 22, 2019","My experience with them has been very good. Their customer service is very quick. They're respectful as well. They have been trustworthy. I would recommend Quicken Loans because they work with you. The main thing that I liked is that they're quick with their services, they're understandable about your situation and help you better it by giving you the loan to achieve your financial gain. For me the process was very quick and easy so I was satisfied with it. I was comfortable with the process in how everything was done. I wasn't overwhelmed because sometimes taking out loans can be overwhelming and time consuming when they do credit history checks. Sometimes they do take some what long because of credit history. They do background checks to make sure that you have good history so you're able to take the loan out for whatever reason you need the loan.",4
Drew,"Cedar Park, TX","Reviewed May 22, 2019",It has been great.

Working with Quicken Loans was super easy, they answered any and all questions and kept us up to date on any information that they needed. Our Mortgage Specialist kept in contact with us and reached out to us regularly, and was always sure to let us know where we were in the process, and ask us if we had any concerns or questions that needed to be answered. It was kind of weird doing everything mostly online, but all in all, it was a good experience.

I really liked the fact that the process was almost entirely online, and I was able to easily reach help whenever needed at any point during the process. There is nothing I particularly dislike about the process, aside from the fact that I was in need of assistance from a live person for some of the otherwise online approval steps.",4
Kraig,"Murfreesboro, TN","Reviewed May 22, 2019",Quicken loans is awesome. You can really tell they are there for you. Throughout the whole process they do great work. This is our 2nd mortgage with them and we refinanced on the second one and paid all our debt off with the loan. I liked doing the majority of the loan process on my phone. The only time we had to meet with anyone was at closing. We signed our paperwork and we were done. They FedEx your papers off and that’s it. You tell them what you want to do and they get back with you really quick. The people who did our appraisal were there within a week or two. They send in the appraisal and you wait for Quicken Loans to get back to you.,5
Josh,"Henderson, TX","Reviewed May 21, 2019",The process of getting a mortgage through Quicken Loans was a very smooth and pleasant experience. Sometimes I would have questions that I was not finding the answer to and they were always quick and helpful to get me the information I needed. It was very productive and was an easy process.

From start to finish they provided me service that excelled in every single way and they were always there when I had a question. I was approved in less than 24 hours and on my way to living in my dream home within a week. Nobody could even come close to offering the quality service that the folks at Quicken offered to me. They made the loan itself so seamless. But that's not all, they assisted me in having my new home appraised before I made an offer on it, then they arranged for an inspection on the home once I made an offer. They completely closed the complete loan with little effort whatsoever on my part at all. ",5

Payge,"Burke, VA","Reviewed May 21, 2019","I generally like how quick and easy it was to get my loan rate percentage. They are relatively quick to get you information and a turnaround. When buying a house the last thing you want to do is take forever to close because you can't get the loan wrapped up. The estimator beat everyone else in the industry by a pretty fair amount. Then when it was finally wrapped up, the rate I got was worse than other loan companies apparently offered but we were so far behind already I didn't want to switch and delay things. Their estimator was very helpful though and we were generally in the ballpark but the rate wasn't as good as the estimate and I had excellent credit. Also, I am tired of getting more communication and adverts, but whatever.",4

Mahdi,"Bayville, NY","Reviewed May 21, 2019",The process of applying was done online and it's pretty much the same as any bank loan. I do feel the whole process was much quicker with less strict qualifications than a bank loan. The loan process was very quick and easy to do. Every stage of the loan process was clearly explained so that I understood everything that I needed to know such as interest rates and fees. I liked that the process of the loan was pretty clear and easily understood. I felt like they cared about me as a person and not just another customer to make a profit from. I highly recommend the service to anyone applying for a mortgage or similar loan. And for first time homebuyers who have little credit history.,5

They don't leave you behind and forget about you for another time. They always do their best to outdo competition. However, they're slow at getting back to you. And that goes for most other companies like them.",4

I like that the always keep your account updated and you have access to all your previous statements. They can even deal with being at least 1 month late on payments. Experience has been average at best. They do their jobs. I just feel like I am a case number to them though. They don't provide much support or advice to help pay off the loan. I just don't like that they have no real financial advisors to help with managing a way to pay of the loan. I would like to see this concept get better so that I have a real fighting chance to pay the loan off.,3

I appreciate what they are doing for me. They sometimes ask me to pay for several things that I wish not to pay for. For example, they want me to sign up with an extra plan. However, I do not need any more benefits from Quicken Loans. It was a bit complicated on the website to get the mortgage plan I wanted, however eventually I did figure it out.

I liked that you apply online and upload your financial information, allowing them to present you with offers that suit you best.

I really liked the easiness and quickness of the app. It was very fast and quick (the service). I would definitely use this again if there were minor improvements. The app could have been better and had a more modern look to it. This also applies to the website. You have to register, give your details and from the website, you can do many action like getting a mortgage or refinancing loans. I think a better UI would really improve the experience.

When we found our dream home a few days later and went back to Quicken to set the closing date. That's when to our surprise the whole process started over again, this time asking for even more documents. For every document we submitted they asked three more documents, each more bizarre than the next. As we voiced our concern and frustration about the barrage of documents QL demanded, staff became more belligerent and combative. Finally we decided to walk away from Quicken Loans and pay cash for the house. Not our first choice, but fortunate for us an option.",1

The other two brokers came in and made subsequent offers unattractive to boost up the attractiveness of the first offer. All three are friends, all three work at Quicken as brokers.

Paul,"US, US","Reviewed Aug. 20, 2018",Filled out some information on LendingTree and got a call from Quicken Loans. The first thing they did was asking for SSN# and my permission to run my credit but I denied. They said they have already got my information from LendingTree and just needed me to verify. Then I provided my SSN# to them BUT I emphasized that I do NOT want them to pull my credit and I just want to know their general rates. They told me they cannot provide me rates without pulling my credit report and kept asking for my permission to run my credit. BUT I SAID NO! I hanged up the phone without getting any information but they still ran my credit without my consent. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE! Ridiculous. Rude!,1

I would definitely recommend this company to my friends and family. In the process of applying for the loan be sure to include all sources of income.

But once you are approved and you start making payments, as far as customer service, and finding someone live to talk to about the status of your mortgage, it is very difficult to get help.

The interface was great and the website itself was crisp and clean and easy to use. The computer made the process a lot easier. Anyone of age can use it. If Quicken Loans had other services available I would use them. The tech support was also very useful and I got an amazing list of assistance points. ,5
Denise,"Sherman Oaks, CA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018","Process was completed online starting with the application and Quicken were very helpful with refi. Have great rate and customer service is excellent. I was working in the mortgage industry myself, so I was surprised at how quickly this was completed. I was referred by my brokerage and I believe this may have played a part in my loan process being so quick and easy. I have since referred my sister too. Referred my daughter as well for a purchase a few months ago and she said the loan process was very easy too.",5
Ray,"Wilbraham, MA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018","Excellent refinancing experience that was amicable. The process was relatively fast. The more prepared you are at the beginning, the faster you can move through the process. Have your paperwork ready to go so the process can move along, including bank statements, income and tax statements, and other financial paperwork that will be needed. We refinanced with all the work done online in a mostly stress free environment. We communicated with maybe two or three different people who were helpful in the process, efficient, and effective. I was satisfied.",5
Wally,"Fredericksburg, VA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018","The customer service is always easy to access. There's never any long hold or automated things to deal with that delay you. Everything is always handled nicely and swiftly. Additionally, there was no endless forms when I actually decided to go through the refinance. Thank you for your customer service on my last issue. It's always nice to get something done and feel like you were successful doing it. Although, having a little more put into an app development could be very helpful and beneficial to the customers. Anything mobile now saves time for people and that's always a plus.",5
Shannon,"California, PA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018",Quicken Loans is a great company and my experience with them was fast and enjoyable. I found a home that me and my family liked and wanted. We then called Quicken Loans who started the loan mortgage process. They had the right people in the right positions. They were fast and knowledgeable about my needs and how to go about getting the loan I needed. They have friendly employees who are knowledgeable about loans and what you need. Quicken Loans helps you get what you need. They helped me get my first house and within a short amount of time.,4
Leigh Ann,"Mchenry, IL","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018","We had a very positive experience with them. I liked that things could be initiated online or via the app, and that the rest was all done over the phone. No sitting in banks and offices for hours at a time. It let us have a life outside of all that stress, and actually be out looking at houses. Moreover, they were very fast, very thorough in explaining everything to us, since we hadn't been through this process in well over 10 years, and were quite responsive when we had questions. My husband called on a whim when we finally had it with our renting situation, and they were very understanding and thorough with him. ",5
Todd,"Temecula, CA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans was really good. Their website was really easy to navigate and they had very helpful direct links if you had any concerns. I appreciate that their name actually is what they mean. They are very fast to get back to you and they made the process of getting a loan very simple and quick if you're short on time. I was satisfied with every little thing about the process and would definitely recommend them.,5
Thomas,"Irvine, CA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018","I am amazed by how fast Quicken was able to get my mortgage taken care of. From start to finish, it was less than thirty days. Even when my representative was on vacation, another rep stepped in and supported me through the process, knowing I was on a tight deadline because I was moving for work. The communication was constant and open. From the very first phone call I had with the rep to begin the pre-approval process all to the day we closed on our home, we had the best home buying experience. Working with Quicken Loans was painless throughout the whole process and I am incredibly pleased with my experience. This company is one of the best on the market.",4
Robert,"Stratford, CT","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2018","Best mortgage experience ever. They explained the HARP program and process very thoroughly and executed my HARP financing quickly and painlessly. They provided a loan that was a full 2.5% less than what I was paying. All of the paperwork is completed online and they send someone to your home to complete the closing. The whole process took about a month and saved me enough to be able to pay extra against the principal every month. However, there's no consideration for current customers when it comes to refinancing even when the current mortgage is being paid ahead of the amortization schedule. Recently, I attempted to refinance with a small amount of cash out as rates have dropped. I also wanted to reduce the term of my loan, but I was denied due to a low credit score caused by unforeseen emergencies.",5
John,"Macomb, IL","Reviewed July 31, 2018","BEWARE! The representative for this company quoted me loan terms (interest rate, closing costs, etc) on the phone with a specific number for closing costs. They did not send the written document with the terms until there were only a few minutes remaining to lock in the rate. The written proposal had closing costs approximately 3 times higher than they quoted me on the phone. I would not trust this company.",1
Mauriel,"Sparta, GA","Reviewed July 31, 2018","We are looking for a VA loan to finance our home. I did an internet search and this company came up. They called me immediately which makes me wonder if that internet search isn't run by them. All I wanted to do initially is talk about if we can refinance a home that we are renovating already. They didn't want to talk, they just wanted all my personal information and to check credit scores. I was not ready for that step. No point if they did not do the type of loan I was requesting. ",1
Jordan,"Riverside, CA","Reviewed July 31, 2018","It was pretty good overall. I liked that everything was laid out very clearly about the steps in the process to doing what I needed to. When I was starting out, they gave me plenty of information about what to expect and what sort of services they offered. They answered all questions really well and I had no major issues. While I felt that at times it took longer for things to happen than I expected, the people involved and the company were very clear about why things were happening at the timeline they were. The customer service was very friendly and the services were reasonable and there weren't really any hidden fees.",4
Ruth,"Newport News, VA","Reviewed July 31, 2018",Quicken Loans was easy to work with and to set up. Liked how they were able to do a 3 way call between myself and my husband who was out of town working with the military at the time we needed the loan. They have always been very upfront about everything that went on. Going great but then was bought by Bank of America. Is now under them and is running smoothly. Have never had any problems and is getting close to being paid off.,4
Anthony,"Springfield Gardens, NY","Reviewed July 31, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans has been great. Respectful employees and fantastic service. They just been so good to me ever since. I liked the easy service with everyone and everything but I did not like how slow they were. The process was a little shaky but I managed.,5
Amarjeet,"South San Francisco, CA","Reviewed July 31, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans has been amazing. I liked the website and interface online and the loan process was really nice. They did their due diligence and the underwriters were really thorough, but they were reliable. They approved me within the closing period of the house and gave me a great rate. They advertised a competitive refinance rate on the phone with me one day. I told them that I was very interested, and expected to hear back from them before the rates were going to rise (fed was to raise interest rates in the next quarter). But they never did, so I refinanced with a different company. I am no longer with Quicken Loans due to a broker-favored refinance, but I would love to go back to them. Their loan website is really nice and my current broker's website is horrible.",4
Debra,"Worden, IL","Reviewed July 31, 2018","We were not sure who to get but I am so glad we got Quicken Loans. They are great! The people are so helpful and very knowledgeable. Their process could not have gone better. We called them and wanted to refinance our house. We will use them when we get ready to move which should be soon.  Everything went very smooth and we had a lot of support along the way and after. Everything was done by phone, computer, and mail. When we closed a man from a nearby town came to our house then we signed papers and it was perfect. I really trust them and I am not a very trusting person! I would recommend Quicken to anyone not sure about the procedure. They will give you all the info you need.",5
Ahyun,"Denver, CO","Reviewed July 31, 2018","I had a blast going through my experience with Quicken Loans. I like that everything was on track and I rarely had to worry. They were always very on task and helpful when I got the chance to contact them. There were days when I had some questions that needed to be answered by them but I was struggling to get in contact with them which made me a little mad and scared at the same time. It was a bit frustrating at first when they didn't reply right away but overall I had a good time and enjoyed their company. As long as you have someone besides you who knows what they are doing if you are new to this whole process like me, it is really easy.",5
Bryan,"Kansas City, MO","Reviewed July 31, 2018","I have found Quicken Loans to be a very helpful and fair company to deal with. They offer reasonable rates and I can work with their people whenever I have a problem. They are also a top company with nothing but good things said about them. I liked the people I worked with and their process is straightforward however expect to get plenty of help along the way. It makes for a nice experience. But sometimes the stuff is hard to understand and I needed clarification. Also, sometimes I was unhappy with how long it took to help me. You need to understand there is nothing that everyone will understand on their own. But overall I would say I am satisfied and would try Quicken Loans again.",4
Brian,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed July 31, 2018","Quicken Loans has really good service. Easiest experience ever and best rate I have ever seen too. Experience matched that of the advertising and they lived up to my expectations. Very fast and accurate, too. Instant quote and no technology issues.",5
Rashunda,"Memphis, TN","Reviewed July 31, 2018","It only took about a week to process the loan. And the customer service over the phone was great. They went over different rates and years of terms I could choose from. I also like the quick paperwork sessions. Easy to transfer the loan from Wells Fargo to Quicken Loans with a cheaper interest rate. However, they wanted to know everybody income in my household. If I am paying for it it should just be mine income only on the paperwork.",4
Stafford,"Provo, UT","Reviewed July 31, 2018","Great and very thorough. Quicken Loans is a leader and an innovator in the mortgage approval process and I liked how they simplified it. It takes out all of the unnecessary paperwork. It is a necessary, comprehensive and step by step process that allows you a pre-approval that's easy and seamless. It also gives you an instant approval.",5
Jack,"Salt Lake City, UT","Reviewed July 31, 2018","I love this company. My experience have been really cool because I think it's easy to use and the bank is really good. I think people should use this type of loan because you can feel more safe and help your family a lot and can have a home. The service customer is really friendly and I find everything in the browser and it was really fast. Sometimes it was slow when I was looking something in web page, because a lot of people enter in this page in the same time. But other than that, the rest of things was amazing.",4
Jennifer,"Bronx, NY","Reviewed July 31, 2018",Great staff and customer service is always on point. They help you with anything you need and never any issues.

I plan on using them for more years to come.,4
Justin,"Portland, OR","Reviewed July 31, 2018","They were very easy to work with and made the whole process simple and straightforward. There were no hidden fees or costs. I was pleased with the process from beginning to end and will use them again if I need to. They are completely understanding of every situation.

I enjoyed my experience with Quicken Loans and would recommend them to anyone that needs a loan or refinancing. I convinced another homeowner to use them for their needs.",5
Mitchell,"Granada Hills, CA","Reviewed July 31, 2018","Excellent application procedure, very fast response, excellent rates, no red tape, easy to contact. Saw ad on t.v., called them, referred to website where I filled out the application and didn't have to provide too much supplementary material and didn’t have the hassle of photographing and downloading tax returns to email to them. The application procedure was much simpler than going with Chase or Bank of America and the response was faster with fewer personal interruptions. But I dislike that no paperwork means no or limited personal contact with explanations of answers to the questions. Also, unable to easily provide supportive documents as there was no fax number that got immediately responded to.",4
Shawn,"Hephzibah, GA","Reviewed July 31, 2018","They're an awesome company to use, they really care about you and your family. I love the way they handle business and the way they make sure you are comfortable. They also make sure they get you what you want and not what you need. They helped me find the house we wanted and get a great rate and I was able to pay my house off earlier than I was supposed to. I talk about how great they are to everyone I know and even on social media sites. When I plan on buying another house I will definitely use them again rather it is by phone or website.",4

My experience with Quicken Loans wasn't bad, but I think it could have been way better though. I don't believe that this is the absolute best way to get a mortgage although it really is amazing. I really liked how it made my loan very easy and fast, and I would recommend this to all my friends who are looking to get a mortgage. I would also recommend this to other people who are looking to get a mortgage on a house.",5

Dale,"Efland, NC","Reviewed July 30, 2018","I went to the website and filled out the information then I received a phone call from a Quicken loan representative. Then from there they guided me through the rest of the process on how to finish obtaining the mortgage that I needed to purchase my home. They were great. They did just what said they were going to do me and got the right mortgage for me and my family. The process was quick and easy. The total time that it took from beginning to end was very fast. I did not have any downtime with this company at all. We did everything by phone, email, and fax. I would recommend this to other if they choose to go this route. Although sometimes you just need that personal touch to go with the process of get a mortgage. At least you get to meet them in person and see who you are working with. It truly was great. I would recommend them to others.",5
Al,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed July 30, 2018","I liked that they worked with me and gave me a killer rate on my mortgaged houses. They were willing to answer any questions that I might have had. Also, I liked that they are as competitive with the bigger banks and only go online to the other banks. I liked that I did not have to go in on a bank. I could do everything from a computer and I can do it as I sit on my couch in comfort. I could use the internet to answer all questions and not be embarrassed. It makes getting a mortgage about as easy as can be. They are very transparent. Quicken Loans seems to be an up and coming loan business and they are very good at what they do. It is not a traditional site and it does not have the history that the other older banks already have.",4
Tammy,"Louisville, KY","Reviewed July 30, 2018","I went online and applied, it was a seamless process. They made it easy to refinance our house and sent a notary to our home so we didn't need to take off work. It was much better than driving to an unfamiliar part of town to an office for closing. They went above and beyond to get me a rate that was right for me. After closing all documents we mailed to the house. Everything was up front, if I had any questions there was a dedicated rep for me to talk to on the phone or in an online chat. Would highly recommend.",5
Shannon,"Fort Worth, TX","Reviewed July 30, 2018",We recommend Quicken to a lot of our family and friends. They helped us when other lenders wouldn't. They had our backs and got us a loan when the first mortgage company made a huge mistake and said they couldn't help us after we were already in contract. Quicken took the time to get all our information and helped us get the best loan for our situation. They have always been helpful and timely in closing our loans. But we had to explain the same things in several different ways and provide written documentation for every aspect of our financial and some personal life.,4
Thomas,"Hattiesburg, MS","Reviewed July 30, 2018",Quicken Loans was very professional and got me the best rate in a very short time.

I was also able to understand every question clearly. Everything about my experience was very good. I would highly recommend Quicken Loans.,5

My transactions were handled via phone, email and fax. Everything was easily facilitated and went through smoothly!  My total experience in working with Quicken Loans was great. All my needs were met and I was very pleased with the outcome of my refinance. In the event I need to refinance again I would most assuredly contact Quicken Loans.

Stacy,"Haddonfield, NJ","Reviewed July 30, 2018","Quicken Loans walks you through the process. They start by asking you clarifying questions so that they know exactly what loan you are looking for. Then there is a credit review. Next, is a good faith deposit. Underwriting occurs next, and finally closing! Quicken Loans was reliable and helpful. They worked with me and made sure that I understood everything that was going on. They worked with me for an FHA loan and I love the fact that it is non bank based. Quicken Loans offers great rates and opportunities for anyone looking for a mortgage. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and they are quick to assist in any way possible. The only thing that I do not like about Quicken Loans is that you can't get home equity loans. Other than that, Quicken Loans has all of the benefits/features that I could want for an online mortgage company.",5
Ricky,"Akron, OH","Reviewed July 30, 2018","These people are very knowledgeable in the home buying process, the market the trends and the loan process. It really surprised me and I'm glad I made that choice. They have been very easy to work with and they held my hand through the whole process. They made me feel confident in the choices I was making. They make you feel comfortable and they follow up with phone calls. Maybe they call a little too often at some inconvenient times but at least they called to reassure me and to let me know how the process was going and for that I was happy. They got me the best rate they could for my credit score. The process was fine and I would use them again. I would recommend them to anyone.",5
Todd,"Simi Valley, CA","Reviewed July 30, 2018","Overall it was very good with web/internet access and easy upload of documentation and records and rather fast process, courteous and knowledgeable representatives, but fees are average, not lower.

It was very reliable and I never had any problems. It was a very good company to have a mortgage with. The customer service that they provided was also very good. I always made my payments on time and the company never did anything to lose my trust or confidence in them. They were able to help me with my situations and I'm thankful.

Zach,"Mcdonough, GA","Reviewed July 29, 2018","Quicken Loans has provided excellent service overall. First, I had to find them online in order to look up the information that was available to me and the estimated interest rates. Then, I met with a representative and we discussed what my options were. They presented me with the facts and offer low interests rates compared to some of the other larger lenders. They also provide you with the tools you need. I finally decided on what was necessary for me and my family for the mortgage. However, it took me a bit of a longer time than another company would have to initially finance the mortgage for my home. Other than that, I liked most of my interactions with their customer service.",3
Cole,"Cherry Hill, NJ","Reviewed July 29, 2018",Quicken Loans is something good. I liked using it when I found out about my mortgage and I found out that I had a very good experience and I could get a lot of work done when using Quicken Loans.

Quicken Loans was also ranked by JD Power and probably as one of the best service I used and I think I can use it again in the future.,4
Cecilia,"Milpitas, CA","Reviewed July 29, 2018","I've received really great service from Quicken Loans, and appreciate it. I love their customer service and it is absolutely top-notch. I even sent a message to my service rep to let him know how much I truly appreciated his help. I told him I wanted him to receive a gift card. Getting my loan through QL was sort of stop-start, but they were able to guide me through the process. They gave me instructions at each step, helping me with what they needed. But I didn't appreciate being contacted by salespeople about redoing my loan when I didn't contact them. The Quicken Loans sales people are very aggressive, with a number of them calling and calling day after day to aggressively try to change my loan. It makes me feel hounded.",4

I'm stress free and I don't have to live my life knowing that I have loan issues. I'm happy in my current situation.,3
Kat,"Newhall, CA","Reviewed July 29, 2018","The first person you speak with is a Quicken Loans salesman. All they want to do is close the deal with scare tactics such as rates are rising, you need to make a non-refundable deposit to secure the current rate. At that point you are passed from person to person during the loan process, never speaking to the same person twice, which I disliked as it was very impersonal. ",1
Bonnie,"Wausau, WI","Reviewed July 29, 2018","They were always switching the people we were deal with. We didn't get to work with one person through the whole ordeal. Also, they were always coming up with new problems and new things they needed after telling us they had everything. It seemed like each new person we had to deal with didn't know what the last person had said or done, and it was like starting all over every time they gave us a new person to deal with. It started out great, with them saying we could get a loan and after a bunch of rigmarole, it ended great when we finally did get the loan.",3
Mary,"Pleasanton, TX","Reviewed July 29, 2018","I first obtained my mortgage as a first time home buyer. They helped me by patiently walking me thru the process and explaining all I needed to know. They were very reassuring, especially when I was unsure about taking out a mortgage. Most pleasant people to work with. However, as I have no fax machine, it seems I made trips to UPS for fax service 1-2 times week for awhile. But if you have all your tax, payroll and credit info handy, that wouldn't be an issue. I was grateful that at the time, I did not need a down payment. As a first time home buyer, things went very well and I am very pleased with Quicken Loans. They were very helpful in assisting me and took a lot of the hassle out of obtaining a mortgage. They refinanced my mortgage with a lower interest rate.

Jenna,"Fayetteville, NC","Reviewed July 29, 2018",Quicken loans had very excellent customer care and service. The interest rates were lower than other physical companies. I was extremely impressed with them and the experience was awesome. They were the first to say that they were going to do it for our home. That part of the story is not the only thing that has been done. They made us a family.,4
Damian,"Provo, UT","Reviewed July 29, 2018","In order to get the loan I first contacted the company by phone. They said in order to get a proper evaluation of my situation they said it was essential for me to come down. I went down and they evaluated my finances and let me know what money was available to me. I like the people who work there, how they talk and how they dress. Their presence is very professional and the atmosphere made me feel very welcome. It was a very efficient atmosphere for me. I was apprehensive at first but the clerks were very helpful to me and let me get the information that was needed. Getting a loan can seem overcomplicated but the helpers made my journey very effective. However, there was one clerk who was very dismissive of me. I'm not sure if she disliked me or was maybe a shy person. I was turned off by her behavior so I tried to concentrate on the big picture rather than that one person.",4
Leah,"Bradenton, FL","Reviewed July 29, 2018","They are a great company. I looked them up and compared them to other companies in my area and found them to be cheaper so I called and purchased their services. It was a simple process.

Kaylee,"Gainesville, FL","Reviewed July 29, 2018","It's been a great experience and I've loved everything about them. They are easy to talk to, super friendly, knowledgeable and get you a good rate.

Evan,"Anderson, MO","Reviewed July 29, 2018","I went to the Quicken Loans website and selected the loan type that I needed. I filled out what seemed like a short and easy application. After the application was submitted, I received a phone call from one of their brokers. From there, the broker helped guide me through the rest of the process. Quicken Loans made the home buying process very easy for this first time home buyer. Without their resources and knowledgeable broker to walk me through the process, I am not sure if I would have bought a home. ",5
Ron,"Pompano Beach, FL","Reviewed July 29, 2018",Quicken Loans has been great. They have been very reliable to my needs. They treat me like a person and I appreciate their service.

Quicken Loans is simply the best that's out there on the market. Give them a try and don't let them pass you by.,4
Samuel,"Arnold, MD","Reviewed July 29, 2018","My overall experience with Quicken Loans was average. They are a subprime mortgage company so it wasn't what I was used to in dealing with one of the major banks which had better customer service, more mortgage options and a better website/online banking options to name a few. The rate was a bit higher than I was used to, but the best thing about Quicken Loans was their approval process was pretty easy. I didn't have to jump through nearly as many hoops as I would of with a top bank. The documents were pretty standard and easy to understand as well. However, the biggest thing I disliked was their online banking features. It was not nearly advanced as the likes of the big banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Chase. I pretty much deal with all my financial endeavors using paperless billing and online features so that made my experience a little frustrating.",3
Scott,"Hemet, CA","Reviewed July 29, 2018","We got our loan through Quicken Loans about 4 years ago, their rates were very competitive and ended up costing less than other mortgage companies. One of the best things was that the loan process was done online and was very quick and convenient.  Everything they said they would do, they did and it was very convenient to use their loan process. I have never had a problem trying to contact them and all information I have ever received from them has been accurate. I would recommend their services to family and friends.",5
Daisy,"Smithfield, NC","Reviewed July 29, 2018","Quicken Loans is out there making money. They are a rip off with the fees they put on you. They charge a big fee just for the application.

Hal,"South Bend, IN","Reviewed July 28, 2018","If you plan on having a perfect life with no money glitches for whatever reason, then you will do OK with QNL. However if life throws you a curveball and bills can't be paid for a time... This mortgage company will fee you to bits. Maybe others do the same? I don't know. They will send out drive-by people to see if your home is occupied, then hit you with a charge for that. Like a drive-by every month. Plus the late FEES FEES FEES.",2
Julie,"Dyersburg, TN","Reviewed July 28, 2018","My husband and I started the process and from that moment on we knew we were going with Quicken Loans. They helped us refinance our home and with a low finance charge. They let you know up front what you will get from them. The process was very easy and they were there all the way. It took so little time and we got a really good rate compared to others that we checked out. If somebody wants to apply with Quicken Loans I will be there to back them. As long as you have good credit Quicken will be there to help you every step of the way, but with bad credit, no.",5
Jennifer,"Bethlehem, PA","Reviewed July 28, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans was very pleasant. I was able to get a loan that satisfy my needs for me and my family.

The mortgage industry can be very strenuous but I'm happy I chose Quicken Loans. I will recommend them.,5
Anne,"Milton, MA","Reviewed July 28, 2018","I have liked all my dealings with Quicken Loans. Everything has been positive from the very first day and I am 9 years in to a 15 year mortgage. The whole process was without a hitch and the interest rate was the best around. Great website with all the information you need and it has everything concerning my mortgage loan, what taxes, insurance are paid and when they are paid. Good customer service, reliable, dependable and on time payments. They are also very prompt. It has been a wonderful experience.",5
Mike,"Johnston, IA","Reviewed July 28, 2018",They were easy to talk to. They had helpful people that were willing to work with me. They were so nice and they wanted us to get what we wanted and they fought to get what they needed to have. When we'd needed help with anything they were fast to get what we needed to do to help. It was easier to get things done with them and we didn't have to worry about what was and wasn't done. They had a check list of things to follow and it made it easy to keep on track and see what we needed to do to be done in a reasonable time. Sometimes it did feel like we had a lot of paperwork that always needed to be done and that there was a lot to fill out but I think that is with any place that you use.,4
Luna,"Campbellsville, KY","Reviewed July 28, 2018","The experience was very good and efficient and the environment is so well. The process of getting the mortgage is very fair and I love it. Every people are always happy and smiling giving off good vibes. All the employees are very polite and I feel very safe here. The company is amazing, very clean and sanitary. Everyone I know goes here and they recommend it. There was a time where Quicken was very sloppy and the people were rude but the environment has changed since then. Sometimes people think that it's annoying but I real don't understand the whole concept. Every time I'm there I feel like I never left my home which is a great feeling.",4
Cheryl,"Byesville, OH","Reviewed July 28, 2018","Our experience with Quicken Loans has been great. We like their fast service. We had our loan within a week. We were able to get just the right loan to fit our needs, and at an interest rate we could afford to pay down very fast. The process was great and straightforward. We had very little we needed to show, or verify for them. We enjoyed learning about how their process worked, and we just went step by step to get it done.",4
Robert,"Franklin, VA","Reviewed July 28, 2018","They were very easy to work with and made the whole process convenient. This was a reverse mortgage so the process started with a TV ad. My wife and I discussed this and decided we should look into it. I called Quicken and got in touch with one of their people who became my main contact throughout the process. He explained the reverse mortgage in more detail which cause us to converse with both of our daughters to make certain that neither of them had an interest in inheriting our home. When this was not an issue we started the process and went to the class with the third party that went into further detail of what happens with the reverse mortgage from the beginning to the end. We made our decision, paid off our line of credit and moved forward with the reverse mortgage. Like most people with any mortgage I would have preferred a lower interest rate but market conditions do not always allow us to get what we want. ",5
Miranda,"Somerset, PA","Reviewed July 28, 2018",I have loved my experience with Quicken Loans! It was quick and easy to get our mortgage and to manage our mortgage payments each month.

Everything has gone so smoothly and I can honestly say that there is nothing wrong with this company at all! Dont think we could have picked a better company.

I liked it when they lent me money for my future like family plans. They also helped me a lot on how to start my business and they lent me a lot of money to start.

Peg,"Lindstrom, MN","Reviewed July 28, 2018","I liked the way it was easy to find out updates on our refinancing online. I also liked how the employees at Quicken called frequently to answer questions that my husband or I had. We liked them, but they can be a bit persistent about is refinancing our home every few years and when we attempt to do it, there is usually some sort of problem with the house appraisal. Also, I disliked the process of refinancing when it reached the end where the house appraisal came in. They told us one number and the interest rate ended up being a lot different that we didn’t want and not as great as it started off.",3
Karen,"Strasburg, VA","Reviewed July 28, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans has been very positive. The employees are very helpful and are there to help every step of the way.

Rita,"Moreno Valley, CA","Reviewed July 28, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans was amazingly great. I felt that they made the whole process easier than it would have been at any other company.

Jonathan,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed July 28, 2018","I searched internet, I came across Quicken so I decided to submit a request online. It didn't take long after I sent my form when I got a real phone call from one of their agents. He ran my info through the system and on the same day he told me I was approved. I had a very enjoyable, enlightening experience as the Quicken Loans officers took the time to answer my questions. They were quick on processing my documents too. I also really liked the speed in which they'd respond to e-mails. It wasn't super fast in 10 minutes, but it was less than one hour. I felt confident that I was being looked after, not that my letter was going into a ""to-do"" junk pile. Only thing is that they can be spammy with follow-up phone calls. It was at least once a day they'd call to try to sell you on something and what made it worse is that they'd even call on weekends too.",4

Jonathan,"Fairfield, CA","Reviewed July 28, 2018","I was recommended this service by a friend who thought that it would be beneficial for me. And I have had a good experience with them so far. Their support individuals are very knowledgeable and are able to get things done quickly. Also the price for their service is very reasonable for what they offer. But I am sort of disappointed at the time it takes to navigate through everything. I feel like this is one of the slower services that I have encountered. Still, Quicken Loans has all the functions and features available to you the instant that you choose them. It is almost like they are waiting for you to pick them.",3

Stewart,"Gulfport, MS","Reviewed July 28, 2018",I initially saw a commercial on Television for Quicken Loans. I called them within a couple days of seeing the ad to get more information on the refinancing process with them. When I finally made the decision to refinance -- one of their representatives came to my home and walked me through the entire process. I refinanced with them which dropped my mortgage interest rate a couple percentage points. I retained my mortgage with them throughout the entire time I had my mortgage until I finally paid my house off. They saved me a lot of money from the time I refinanced with them until I managed to pay my mortgage off. The money I saved on my mortgage while dealing with them was astronomical. I disliked having to get the paperwork done but even that was not all that terrible.,5
John,"Salt Lake City, UT","Reviewed July 28, 2018",Going through the process Quicken Loans was actually pretty good and I was not expecting it to be super easy and smooth. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. Quicken Loans had a nice cool app with a great UI and it was easy to check on the app during anytime of the day no matter what I was doing. The app had a lot of functions too that were really useful. I liked how smooth and efficient the process was with Quicken Loans. They had great customer service to make sure I didn't lose my house and that I did everything properly so that was a big up. The only thing I didn't like about Quicken Loans is that its stock was fluctuating unpredictably on the stock market because otherwise I would have invested in their stock on the stock market.,4
Christine,"Waterbury, CT","Reviewed July 28, 2018","I used Quicken Loans online to get a quote to refinance my current mortgage to see where I stand for interest rates. I liked that it can be done with a simple form and some personal information that is very easy to get the ball rolling. After submitting information Quicken Loans sent me a email to let me know that the information was received, and that they will get back to me soon. Quicken Loans got back to me later that day to see if I had received my quote and how I can get a hold of them for further information or questions, the quote contained all the information I needed to proceed in a refinancing loan. Overall, they were very good at doing what they claim to be able to you.",5

You can view rates, read details and negotiate through the web before even talking to somebody. But if you prefer to talk to someone faced to faced you have that option also. They are trustworthy and reliable. They make sure that you are comfortable with the rates and agreements before you sign anything and there is no pressure. When I first started dealing with them they made me their first priority. They always go out of their way to provide the best deals. I liked that their rates were transparent. I did not have to ask about details yet they already presented it to me and gave me enough time to weigh my options.

Cirene,"Newport, ME","Reviewed July 27, 2018",The process of getting a mortgage with Quicken is quick and easy and they guide you every step of the way to make you feel secure and like you’re taking the right steps. It’s not confusing like at some places and it’s very user-friendly. They have excellent customer service and were always there for me to meet any needs I had.

China,"Detroit, MI","Reviewed July 27, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans has been bittersweet. The process was faster than I thought. I gave them my income and information and they used that to come up with a figure and I was done in about an hour or less. They are always there when you need them but I would like them to be more understanding of certain incidents and not be so high on late fees, which I dislike, including their interest rates. I have had other mortgage companies and they did have interest of course and charged late fees but none of them were ever as high as Quicken Loans. Nevertheless, I love Quicken Loans' reliability and quickness. I never waited longer than ten minutes to be served and I never had to worry about them taking anything.",3

June,"Lusby, MD","Reviewed July 26, 2018",The first step seemed to be very easy. Just type in your answers and hit send. This seemed to be a quick way to apply for a refi without a lot of paperwork and people around your home. Then it became more of a hassle than we were wanting to go through via an online service. It was one phone call after the other. All the emails and phone calls seem to take more time than our original mortgage. After a few rather long phone calls we decided to cancel the loan and refi and that seemed to even cause more phone calls. Things were not as good as we had hoped so we switched to a more mainstream company which seems like a bad idea also. We should have gone with a more traditional company like our local credit union.,2

I like paying online and being able to add extra money to the principal when I can. While the rate of interest was very reasonable, I would like to have more knowledge about how escrow is handled.

I like the way they treated right from the start of the mortgage process till the end. I don't know what I would have done without them. I have been with them for years. They are very rigid and don't remove late fees. The phone calls I get are very polite and informative. But sometimes it can get a little annoying. Also, they don't offer home equity loans which is really sad because there're a lot of people who really need that. Face to face service isn't available and they don't consider alternative credit data, too. I ended up staying with them anyways.",4
Tom,"Durham, NC","Reviewed July 26, 2018","A very useful online tool and site. I was able to find a mortgage with terms and rates that I was comfortable with undertaking. This process involved inputting my information regarding income and what I needed, waiting for the results determining which terms and rates were most advantageous for me, accepting the package, providing the required paperwork and accepting the final approval then finding a home that was right for me. The process went as expected with no problems, delays or excessive paperwork. A relatively pain free process with knowledgeable professionals who made the process error free and with less stress than I am accustomed to dealing with in these situations.",3
Nicole,"Grove City, PA","Reviewed July 26, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans was quick and easy. It was great experience. The customer service was exceptionally friendly and helpful in finding the correct loans. They are a good company to get help refinancing your mortgage.,3
Alex Jones,"Placentia, CA","Reviewed July 26, 2018","Quicken Loans has always treated me very good and all of the things and benefits of the loans and the banks have been good as well. It always shows that loans are always a good choice and are easy to pay back. I don't like that sometimes it will destroy me, but I think business and paying taxes and bills will always help me and it never always goes wrong and it always wants to be my way. Quicken Loans customer support is very good. If I had a bad experience I would always tell them because I respect everyone I see. The mortgage is very nice and the down payment has always help me.",2
Robert,"Orlando, FL","Reviewed July 26, 2018",It was such an amazing and positive experience while using Quicken Loans services. I'm very happy using them and I liked everything about them.

Jocelyn,"East Hartford, CT","Reviewed July 26, 2018","When I first started it was my first time opening up a mortgage so it was a little difficult and confusing but it was so easy because after the first 20 minutes it all made sense. I love how Quicken Loans was easy to use, how it helped me a lot, and lastly, how it was so affordable especially because I'm a college student and I only work part time so this made my life so much more easier. Over the many years I have had Quicken Loans, nothing was difficult for me. My experience has been amazing, Quicken Loans has helped me so much over the years and I will continue to use it.",5
Patricia,"Pickerington, OH","Reviewed July 26, 2018","Once, Quicken Loans didn't get back to us when they said they would. They also got our address wrong on one of the papers. The appraiser wasn't a people person as well. But very helpful customer service employees, most of it was over the phone and through emails. The appraisal was fair and done in a timely manner too. The interest rate was also very good. Everything moved along rather quickly from the appraisal through the final signing. The final papers were signed two weeks after we started. I was very satisfied with the customer service representatives. The customer service employees were very professional and accurate. The appraiser was thorough and quick as well (we had the appraisal in two days).",4
Angel,"Fayetteville, NC","Reviewed July 26, 2018",I was approved for a loan pretty quick not much difficulty on the whole applying process. I went online and had to fill out personal info after that I had to wait to get approved. I also like the great customer service they provide.,4

I have recommended Quicken to my colleagues and my family members.",4
Mikayla,"Hurricane, WV","Reviewed July 26, 2018","They did an extremely amazing job giving us an estimate on what damages needed to be fixed. Additionally, they were extremely reasonable. They understand when we had water damage and requested to have it looked at by another person for free. The man who came to my home to check out was very polite. Took his time taking photos of the damages. And he also gave me a rough estimate as to how much I would receive to fix my home. I liked that I contacted off their website and within 2 days they had called and set up an appointment to come and check our house out. Within the next week we had our money. My experience was amazing.",5
Jennifer,"Lanham, MD","Reviewed July 26, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans has been really good. And I liked how easy it was to acquire the loans. The process is really quick and I actually got to use the loan as soon as I wanted. The process is quicker than trying to get a regular loan from a bank, but it still takes a while. The employees I interacted with were so nice, friendly and very helpful.",5
Bambi,"Somerville, MA","Reviewed July 26, 2018","Quicken Loans was able to get me an affordable mortgage with the lowest rate. It was fast and easy and I did it all online. Uploading documentation was easy. Their online calculator app helped me to calculate the right loan option for me. And I got the best loan for my situation and for the house I wanted. However, I spoke to an agent to help me and they cleared up concerns I had with a particular option. I experienced the best customer service in the entire process, since I had a lot of questions.",5
Chelle,"North Olmsted, OH","Reviewed July 26, 2018","Good experience with Quicken Loans. Their customer service was always wonderful. I could always count on getting a human voice on the other end when I would call. They will walk you through every step of the process and will answer any questions you may have. They will continue to help through the life of the loan. We met at the loan office with the loan officer. He went through the loan process with us to be sure we understood the process. We then went through each form individually and signed and/or initialed each one of them. He then provided us with our own copies of the paperwork and handed us the keys to the house. Additionally, Quicken Loans does not tend to sell their loans off like other loan companies do. They normally service their loans from cradle to grave. I would highly recommend Quicken Loans as a mortgage company to anyone.",5
Dominique,"Tulsa, OK","Reviewed July 26, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans was great. I liked their website and the professional way the company treated me and the other clients that I know.

He also helped me throughout the process. The process was quick and easy as well. They did their best to serve my needs and the rates were fair and very balanced.,5
Sandra,"Del Rio, TX","Reviewed July 26, 2018","It's been very easy to deal with them. They made the process of getting a mortgage an easy project without too much frustration. I like how the people I dealt with explained everything in terms I understood and if I had questions they took the time to explain to me everything until I had a good understanding of what was going on and happening. They went through every step with me helping me in making my dream come true. However, I would of liked the process to of gone a bit quicker instead of waiting to hear about what the results would be.",5
Tiffany,"Albertville, AL","Reviewed July 26, 2018","Great! Fast approval and friendly service. Get a preapproval was the first step. This is important to know how much a lender will loan. Next a look at your credit score. Next is to calculate income. The next step was being matched up to the company. They lend money and manage payments. They have fewer servicing fees. Offers multiple payment options which is convenience. Experience client experience that cares. Customer service is the first important factor. They were experienced and kind. Can pay in person, online, or over the phone. The price does not go up too. They really fit your budget. However, problems that may occur is credit score. A bad score can turn someone away and be denied. The sensitive underwriting is another part that can be effective. Low income and credit history are the most important factors companies look at.",5
Carleigh,"Gainesville, FL","Reviewed July 26, 2018","Quicken Loans was pretty great at my mortgage. They were kind, friendly, and prompt about helping us find our perfect home and answering any questions we had about financing our home. And what I really liked about Quicken Loans was how everything was online. It made it very convenient for my husband and I to use. I liked doing everything online and being able to track the status online without having to constantly calling the bank. We were able to do everything from home when we both got off from work. However, I did not like their process for matching us with a realtor. I do not think they matched me with a realtor who had my best interest at heart. Hated my realtor. She was not great and I ended up finding my own. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend it to friends and family if they asked me about it.",4
Bailey,"Burlington, NJ","Reviewed July 26, 2018",Quicken Loans was good but then it was really bad because they didn't call often and that made me really upset so I had to make a report about that to the president of the company. They should call you and make sure that you are ok and see if you are sure. They didn't really like to help me out so I had to change my appointment to join with a brand new company.,1
Amanda,"Scottsdale, AZ","Reviewed July 26, 2018",It's wonderful to get the loan you need. This company cares about its work and its service is world class. They go above and they offer amazing service and product. And I like the quality of service. You can not find this level of service anywhere else. All of the  employees and staff were courteous and kind. They helped me from beginning to end and every step along the way giving me additional information. Even when I was confused they found a way to take care of me. They made the process simply easy and super informative. They were fun and easy to work with also! I felt like a valued customer and even a friend!,5
John,"Hilliard, FL","Reviewed July 25, 2018","Was searching online for a lender that did VA construction loans. Quicken loans contacted me 10 microseconds after I submitted the query.

He transfers me to Isaac ** - Senior mortgage Banker. I explain to him that I am looking for a VA construction loan. He repays, no problem. Proceeds to take all my information as well as my co borrower. Pulls a credit report on both of us. Says he will call me back with the loan package.",1

As soon as I closed on the home I found that there was no heating or cooling in half the house. Plumbing issues and electrical. I have also had to buy a refrigerator and washer. I was assured I could afford the payment. I was depending on my Father-in-law. He was going to help me but this money was not counted. Well he passed away and now after 6 months I was late on my first payment which they told me was ok but immediately turned it over to the credit bureaus.,1
Travis,"Joplin, MO","Reviewed July 25, 2018",Quicken Loans was a very easy company to work with especially if you have great credit. The online process is simple and straightforward and their customer service is outstanding. I was highly impressed with the whole process.,5
Gregory,"Fort Washington, MD","Reviewed July 25, 2018",I had an easy time using Quicken Loans and I liked the efficiency of how well this process went. They have been very understanding and were willing to work with me. They were helping me out at every turn and I couldn't be more happy to get what I needed for this. It took a lot of back and forth but it was completely worth it when I was told I got the amount needed for the mortgage. An amount that was well needed to get the keys in my hand. I was able to get everything I need done within a decent time and never really had an issue with the person who worked with me during this process. It worth at least a try to see if you could get more out of it than with other mortgages. I have a lot of faith in this company and they have never given me a reason to doubt them.,5
Jose,"Buffalo, NY","Reviewed July 25, 2018","The agents who were there to assist me were friendly and found every possible solution to help my home. I like the steps they took to help me pay off my mortgage and how they decided how much money I should get based on my age and driving record. They were very useful when it came to solving my loans and the steps I should take to pay off my mortgage. I liked the low fees they have as a result of the loans and they have good dates for payments unlike any other company out there. However, I disliked the amount of money I received to pay off my mortgage as my job is a minimum wage job that I went to college for ten years. It really sucks.",3
Kevin,"Brooklyn, NY","Reviewed July 25, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans went as smoothly as it was supposed to be expected and with no real problems or issues like the cost of paying the mortgage. I liked how Quicken Loans did not have any hidden fees like other companies would tend to throw at you out of nowhere. They do not have any games or tricks to make the payment complicated.,4
Robert,"Avondale, AZ","Reviewed July 25, 2018",I applied online and was told within minutes about approval. I filled out some paperwork and talked over the phone with a few people. Days later I was ready to purchase my home. They've given me a good loan for a unbeatable amount and I have good interest rates. They have worked with me on past due amounts. They have also communicated with me very well. I receive letters constantly about my loan in the mail. But I dislike their process on late payments and working with you on them. They try to refuse late payment and they speak one thing but their actions show something else. They have also been rude. They have lied to me about owing one amount and then told me a different amount when I went to pay it. I almost lost my home because of this.,3
Alys,"Brooklyn, NY","Reviewed July 25, 2018","Quicken Loans got the job done. There was nothing really fantastic about the service or the customer experience - I don't think anything really differentiates it from other brands. But I do feel like I paid a reasonable amount and the company is a good example of what mortgages should be. I liked that it was easy and efficient. There were no annoying hold times when I had to make a phone call, and there were also never any incorrect charges I had to worry about remedying. However, I never really felt like a valued customer. They didn't do anything to make me feel like I mattered to them, and I never got the impression that my best interests were in their mind. Even so, I had a pretty enjoyable experience. I got a mortgage with them by registering online and getting approved. There were also a couple of quick phone calls where I asked some questions and the customer service reps were very patient and helpful.",3
Beth,"Coarsegold, CA","Reviewed July 25, 2018","My husband takes care of this kind of business in our household and we have paid off our house. He was lured into the loan due to the low interest rates that were being offered. When I was inquiring as to the loan, since my husband had taken the loan, they would not tell me anything until they got the ok from him... not even general information on the re-finance aspect. I did not deal with the company, per se, until pay-off time. We were trying to decide as to whether pay-off or just pay down and I ask about different programs that would allow you to do that and they were not helpful to me at all. But it worked for us, we have paid off this loan and I am glad that I don't have to pay this bill anymore.",3
Lois,"Plantation, FL","Reviewed July 25, 2018","I was leery of Quicken Loans at the beginning but as time went on my confidence grew to the point that I'm now recommending them to friends. My experience with them was excellent and fast. They did everything for me in a timely manner, were polite and answered every question so I understood the entire process. I had one person to work with so I wasn't bounced from person to person. My loan closed within 30 days which is exactly what they told me when I started with them. They did it all and even sent a notary to my home when it was time to close so I never had to travel to them. This is the first time I've had such an easy time getting a mortgage with no surprises.",5
James,"Port Saint Lucie, FL","Reviewed July 25, 2018",I had a great time with them. They were well organized had answered all my questions. They helped me during the closing process just a wonderful group of people at my local office if I needed. They were quick just like their names said.,4
Eric,"Cornelius, NC","Reviewed July 25, 2018","Experience was positive - loan closed on time. The loan process was straightforward and progressed as expected. I liked the speed/rapidity with which the process was executed and we completed the entire refinancing project. There were no unexpected hurdles or ""gotcha"" moments during the process. All told, it was a smooth, efficient process. They were professional & easy to work with. Loan was quickly sold to another servicer, but that turned out to be OK and had no bearing on my feelings about Quicken.",4

Nevertheless, they are a great company that has great customer service representatives that took care of all of the concerns that I had and put my family first in getting me a fair price on my house.",4
Ana,"Morgan Hill, CA","Reviewed July 25, 2018","I was told by Washington Mutual to contact Quicken about re-financing as they wouldn't do it directly. Quicken Loans was persistent as they kept calling me back - and I had to eventually say - ""Please stop, this is not convenient at least."" Also, I was annoyed that my actual bank mortgage wasn't interested in dealing with me - and had ""fobbed"" me off to Quicken. Then, when Quicken would only talk to me real-time on the phone, instead of having a website or email for communication, that was a complete deal breaker. I just gave up, as I had no interest in spending long periods of time giving them information during business hours on the phone. Since they couldn't adapt their methods to me as a prospective customer, I decide this wasn't a company I wanted to deal with.",2
Thomas,"Cleveland, TN","Reviewed July 25, 2018","I thought the process would go by smoothly while purchasing my home. I have known at least 3 people who have used Quicken Loans and have had no problems, but that wasn't the case for me. I have moderately good credit and I thought that would help me. But the process was slow and they have made things more complicated than what they should have been. They need to get more trained people who know what they are doing. Nevertheless, I was happy once everything was settled. They have been nothing but helpful and understanding and I appreciate them. I have heard many good things and I will recommend them to whoever is considering using Quicken Loans.",5
Sean,"East Chicago, IN","Reviewed July 25, 2018","I went through a small process with Quicken Loans. Anthony at Quicken was great throughout the whole process. It felt like talking to an actual friend who really cared. He was always very prompt in responding and very knowledgeable. It just felt easy talking to him. Would definitely recommend.

Sarah,"Denver, CO","Reviewed July 25, 2018","Quicken Loans refinanced my home mortgage loan and gave me a lower interest rate. I liked the ability that they had to look over all the mortgage loan products we qualified for and then advise us on the benefits and negatives of each loan product. Also, I liked that I could scan in the documents they needed and email them securely to the associate I was working with. I liked the agent we worked with and that they try to make the process as ""green"" as possible. Overall the experience was positive because I am saving money. But I dislike the company they sold our mortgage to, Freedom Mortgage. Freedom Mortgage's website and services are extremely outdated. I cannot make additional principle or escrow payments on their website.",3
Diana,"Union City, CA","Reviewed July 25, 2018","We did a refinance back in 2005 and they sold our mortgage to Bank of America in less than a year after financing. I would not use them again because they did not seem to really get involved with our circumstances just to do the refinance quick. The process was too impersonal. We never met with anyone or discussed why we were refinancing. Had to include all debt so didn't have as much cash out as needed. But it was easy to submit financial info and get approved. The application was easy to complete and submit. Everything was done via email, phone and online. After application submitted, emailed copies of financial documents. Waited for approval then notary was sent to house to sign all loan docs. She had minimal explanation of loan. Tried to get good interest rate, but wasn't the best.",3
John,"Mckinney, TX","Reviewed July 25, 2018",It has very good advertising and they are competitive on the market. I liked the process of installing an application in my phone called Rocket Mortgage. This app makes the mortgage very easy to do from the comfort of your home and also you get preapproved in minutes. That is the best part about this whole process and currently the best option on the market. I would recommend Quicken Loans to anyone looking for a mortgage either if it's a new one or a refinance of their current one.,4
Sean,"Judsonia, AR","Reviewed July 25, 2018","Quicken Loans has been really pleasant and I feel like they are a great service.

They are kind of expensive on everything but overall it really helped me figure out how to get everything done quickly and on time. It couldn't have gone as smooth as it did.",5

Seller paid $2000 and I had to pay over $11,500 in remaining fees. Ridiculous. I have bought 6 homes in my lifetime and never paid more than $4,000 in closing costs. That is until I used Quicken Loans. They should change their name to expensive loans. They will also push your interest rate up higher than what they quote you when it comes time for the loan to finalize on closing day.",1

The long-term was reasonable and it market share rate I find very nice. I'm a homeowner. No doubt but the frustrating part is too many companies that say they going to do the right thing but they don't. Quicken Loans one of the very few wants that's comprehensions or know the understand that today's market and competitive market demands a new way of thinking.,3
Charles,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed July 24, 2018","I liked how easy it was to fill out the application with Quicken Loans online and then how quickly I got a call to discuss my application. They made sure that everything was explained before moving forward with my application. The rates was unbelievable and the amount was great. I liked how there was other options to choose from if the initial offer was something I did not like. The employee I worked with never judged me or made me feel stupid when I had a question and the response time when I emailed them with a question was quick as well. However, being on hold when I was on the phone was a nuisance, and also being passed on to another agent without the previous agent telling them what my issue or issues was. But other than that, they helped me with the entire process and even made sure I understood everything. Quicken Loans was a great experience.",5

The mortgage process went more smoothly than any previous companies I have worked with. They let me know exactly what paperwork and information I needed to get right from the start. Other companies would tell me 2 or 3 things I needed to get for them. Once I got what they had asked for, they would ask for more. Knowing everything I needed from the start made things go smoothly. Everything moved in a timely manner as well. My previous mortgage company required an extension to finalize my purchase because they were less organized. Additionally, nearly all of our communication was done by email due to my availability. They also came to my home to do the closing. That was very convenient. I have, and will continue to let friends and family know they are a great company.",5
Peter,"South Burlington, VT","Reviewed July 24, 2018",The experience was about what I'd expect. Quicken Loans is well organized and they were very professional.

They gave me a lot of information about Quicken Loans and their services and they were able to answer questions about moving mortgages over and refinancing. I would recommend to anyone to use Quicken Loans for mortgage services.,5
Samantha,"Dayton, OH","Reviewed July 24, 2018","With Quicken Loans, it was easy to find a good loan for a good price. The loan Quicken Loans provided for my home was affordable and high-quality and gave my family and I exactly what we needed for our home. Quicken Loan's website is easy to use and well-organized, so you can easily find what you're looking for. After requesting a quote, Quicken Loans managed to find me a good quote in just a few seconds. They help you with the entire process of finding just the right loan for you. However, the process of signing on for a loan took a while to do. Some of the instructions weren't clear and it took a few minutes for me to receive help with signing on to a loan. I also wish their loan signing process was a little more detailed. Nevertheless, I would definitely use Quicken Loans again in the future.",4
Jay,"Cocoa, FL","Reviewed July 24, 2018","It's been great. I liked the customer service. I contacted them and they said they could help me as soon as I was available. When I was ready to get help, they assisted me right away. They were easy to assist me when I had questions. They also helped me out with getting my loan quick and easily. They were helping me out throughout the entire process, and without them, I don't think I would be able to get a loan anywhere else. They were there the entire time with me.",5
Scott,"Waxahachie, TX","Reviewed July 24, 2018","I love Quicken Loans. It was one of the best experiences of my life. We went online, filled out an application, got approved very fast, and went from there. They made everything so easy for us to buy our first home. My family had nothing but a pleasant experience going through them. We had someone who cared right by our side the whole way through. We closed quickly and were moved in in no time. We had been turned on to Quicken Loans by a family member, and they were right about them.",5
Joseph,"Garland, TX","Reviewed July 24, 2018","Quicken Loans had a business to do with making a loan plan and payments with rates superior to make the financing over few years. The planning with a set of plan to make the mortgage suited for years to come. I had liked Quicken Loans with a good feeling to make the plan worked for a period of time. I would use the company to make a payment based on a rate being somewhat lower as I follow along with frequent payments, and what I can make a difference in time and thinking.",5
Zakia,"Miami, FL","Reviewed July 24, 2018","I had a loan mortgage with Quicken Loans in the past for more than 10 years. I use the company. Very helpful and reliable to me. They are very friendly. They offers very effective services which are very attractive and important. I have got the loans very easily and the loans are very affordable for me. I can easily pay off the loans, too. I liked the entire process. It would be very helpful to everyone considering using Quicken Loans.",5
Jessica,"Fayetteville, WV","Reviewed July 24, 2018","Quicken was helpful, friendly, courteous and very attentive. They met our particular needs. Also, getting the loan was a very quick and easy process. I called the company and made an appointment to come in and speak with them. Although it is stereotypical to have a lot of paperwork when applying for a loan with a company, I wish the paperwork could have been shortened. Otherwise, it was a good experience and if I were to do another loan I would do it with them. I would also recommend them to friends and family if they were considering a loan.",5
Jeffery,"Beulah, MI","Reviewed July 23, 2018","Like many of the others, I must have been out of my mind. I lost $695 of which I could not get back. I gave them everything they asked for (sometimes they asked me for the same thing several times in my 'to do list', and I kept telling them they already had it). Eventually received an approval letter, but to my surprise, even though my employers validated my employment/income, they would not accept my income as I did not work there long enough. I requested a different Solutions Consultant, but was led around for days trying to get answers as to why this happened. Nowhere during this process was length of employment ever disclosed to me as a condition of loan approval. Actually, they kept telling me everything was going great and it wouldn't take much longer.

Kim,"Lansing, MI","Reviewed July 23, 2018","I had a friendly banker who made things very clear and kept me updated through the whole process and Quicken still keeps me updated. I can access my account information at anytime to get information on my taxes, principal, interest, payments, and changes to my account. Any updates that occur they send me a email so I can check the status of my account. The personnel were always available 24/7 and they provided quick feedback and honest service. However, the initial process was hectic. I would turn in 3 paperwork and have three more to turn in the next day. And all online so I made many trips to fax paperwork to them. I liked that I knew right away if I could be financed with them. I just didn't like that all the extra fixes felt like I had an extra full-time job. But it was worth it in the end.",4
Don,"San Jose, CA","Reviewed July 23, 2018","The process with Quicken Loans has been very quick and efficient, due in part to the fact it was done online without any real slowing bureaucratic processes involved. One of my minor hitches with the company is that the speed of the loan was coupled with less-than-optimal information about said loan until a few days later, when it had already been confirmed. But the low interests rates (relatively) really saved me from financial strain while looking for a new job to actually pay off my 2 mortgages and their reasonable pay-back time meant that I had a very good chance of actually paying back my loaned money in their defined timeframe.",4
Angela,"Hickory Hills, IL","Reviewed July 23, 2018",We did an internet search for the best rate. There were many options out there and there were two choices we were debating on using but Quicken Loans was the best one for us. We heard from a friend that they were very good and great to work with so we went with them and are very happy. The service and reps were very nice and accommodating and we really enjoyed the easy process of getting a loan as soon as possible and it was great. I am pleased with their service thus far. The service and the help was outstanding and we will definitely use them again and again if needed. A very good experience and very reliable company.,5
Britt,"Milton, PA","Reviewed July 23, 2018",My experience was okay. They helped as much as they could but at the time the interest rates they were offering were pretty high. And they wanted a lot of money up front which was more than other places had wanted when I went around asking them. So I ended up having the loan switched over to a bank. It was cheaper in interest rates so my payments were a lot less for me which was nice. This was a loan on a home.,3
Sarah,"Lawrenceburg, KY","Reviewed July 23, 2018","All around a very good experience. Very quick process so I could get into my new home. Understanding processing, good credit rate. I really really liked their easy payment options. Things that fit my budget. Fast processing and approval rate. Friendly staff, too.",4
Bonnie,"Saint Paul, MN","Reviewed July 23, 2018","It was very easy to refinance a mortgage with this company. It was a fast and simple process. I did not have to provide a lot of information to refinance and I was still approved quickly for the mortgage. I liked that it was mostly online, and then once I was approved, a notary public came to my house and we filled out the remaining paperwork in my living room so I didn't have to go anywhere.",5
Samantha,"Columbia, TN","Reviewed July 23, 2018","Quicken Loans had great, fast and friendly service. They were also easy to work with. We asked everything we need up front to get what we wanted and they had us bring in all the paperwork so no going back and forth. We got a fair rate and the price we wanted for the home we bought.",5
Sasha,"Whittier, CA","Reviewed July 23, 2018","I like Quicken Loans a lot. It has been great and they have been very helpful. They have prevented me from doing a lot of payments. I loved the suggestions but they also had many help with payments for beautiful homes and giant ones too. Also the customer service was very kind and had a great reliable tone especially on the phone. The process of getting a mortgage was very slow but it was worth it in the end because I ended up with the nice big and beautiful house I fell in love with. I just wish the retailors didn't sound so very unsure about their suggested loans and finance work. Also, I disliked the uncertain suggestions and slow paperwork because I was at a very fast time and the loans didn't come as soon as possible. They came very slowly.",4
George,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed July 23, 2018","My Quicken Loans has been an easy and trusting one since I worked with great people who made sure that I was treated fairly. However, it can be kind of a hassle to get in contact with them if I had any questions or issues with their service but that didn't happen often so I was okay. I liked that I was able to do this all online which made it easy to figure out the right mortgage plan for me and it used language I understood easily. And I liked that I was able to have the proper tool to make sure that I was paying off my mortgage fairly and I had a plan that was easy to follow through. I recommend this company.",5
Jason,"Tobyhanna, PA","Reviewed July 23, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans was excellent, I was able to get the right type of fast loan with very acceptable rates. I like the fact that my officer was exceptional and willing to work with my case scenario to have the best rates available. They provided excellent service when I was in need. This made me able to catch up on back payments on my mortgage. I really did not want to refinance my home which would send my rates into the ceiling. At first the process with Quicken Loans took some time to ensure I was using the absolute best coverage, this I disliked until I was able to negotiate the terms of my loan. I will definitely use the Quicken Loan services in the future.",5
Paige,"Monroe, GA","Reviewed July 23, 2018",Quicken Loans was amazing through the whole process and made it super easy for us. We like how quick and easy they were to deal with. They set up everything and had it where everyone came to us. Which was amazing for us since we both work and have a baby at home. They also sent someone to us on the date and time we requested to close on the house. They also answered all and any questions we had no matter what time of day it was. They described everything that was going to happen all the way up until the closing. ,5
Gwyneth,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed July 23, 2018","Quicken Loans helped me with every mortgage product that I needed. It was a very good experience. They are a very helpful company and they don't ever hesitate to serve the customers needs. I also liked how the people and advisors were really friendly to me and they made sure that I had everything I needed to settle out my payment plan. I really liked this company and I don't think that I'll ever switch to another one, seeing as though my mortgage is going great and Quicken Loans is doing it all for me. However, they could have been a little faster with the whole contact process. They were a little slacking off during the process, but I could see that is understandable as they probably have a ton of other clients to take on at the same time as me. I liked the way that everything worked out.",4
Kylie,"Lebanon, OH","Reviewed July 23, 2018","They have been decently accommodating to our needs in the past. We went bankrupt in 2012, so that was rough, but they've been working with us. We're looking to refinance or mortgage here soon. Our communications with them over that have been nice as well. However, anything regarding money is always slightly a hassle, since you're dealing with money you don't have. Loans are always painful to take out, and there's this big long process to make sure you're qualified and will be able to pay them back. It's nuts all around not a ton of fun for anyone involved. I did a lot of research online before I took out the loan. I would recommend reading tons of articles and blogs before you go about getting a home loan. Read personal experience stories from people with similar backgrounds to yours. Also, talk to people you know who have gone through the same thing.",3
Kit,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed July 23, 2018",I was looking up online for the brand reputation and reviews about Quicken Loans. And I found a lot of positive things customers were telling about it. I needed a loan and I was in the beginning kinda skeptical if Quicken Loans is a good choice. But all these reviews helped me a lot and are making it way easier to choose this company. I liked that I could set up online and everything was very easy and fast. It also saved me a lot of time and energy to go to a branch and talk with someone about the loan I needed. Very helpful email service on top and I got a response right away back and a day later I was approved for the loan I wanted. It was a great positive experience. Quicken Loans is so far the best loan company I had from all.,4
Robert,"Lexington Park, MD","Reviewed July 23, 2018","I like the entire process. Quick and fairly painless. Filled out all personal information on website like SS#, salaries, and location of property and submit request. Very easy to use several options and took one with the best rates. However, was unsure if website safe at first, nervous about identity theft.",3
Stan,"Bloomington, IL","Reviewed July 23, 2018","It was horrible and expensive. People should not trust this kind of service when considering businesses to receive a loan from. Also, the fee schedule was both confusing and misleading. It was also hard to get any help with a real person when trying to get my questions answered in a timely matter. I do not believe that I would use the service again. The application process was very fluid but getting anything past that point was a huge headache. I have been pretty disappointed in the entire process after that and paid off my loan as soon as possible.",1
Scott,"Arnold, MO","Reviewed July 23, 2018",Quicken Loans is a very modern company and I have been very pleased with them. The best part about working with them is the superior customer service. The mortgage officer was very knowledgeable and all the representatives were very helpful and kind. They made the process quick and easy. I met with a loan officer and we closed on the home in less than 45 days. I am glad that I went with Quicken Loans. If I ever need a mortgage company in the future I will go back to them. I highly recommend this company to anyone seeking a mortgage.,5
Mumieb,"Newark, NJ","Reviewed July 23, 2018","The experience with Quicken Loans has been a little good. I was doubtful at first, but I eventually began to like it. It turned out to be satisfactory. They treat me really well and they don't charge me too much money to use their services. In the beginning, I disliked how much it costed to use their services. But as time went by, they began to lower their fees and everything was fine by then. I liked how reasonable they were when it came to negotiating the refinancing part. I'd suggest something and they'd carefully take it into consideration and try to make an agreement with me when they were deciding what we should do. They were not judgmental at all and they were kind and considerate. I liked how easy it was to sign up for their services and use their business for my house. I also liked how it didn't take long for them to start using their services for me as a customer too.",4
Paul,"Middlesboro, KY","Reviewed July 23, 2018","Quicken Loans is a very good one that they have offer me more than I hope that I can ever get out of from anyone that is about to able me to get what I want in a home. I like that something about paying a lot of money that I can give back to this company because money these days are on a very tight experience for everyone that needs the money to help them out. Also, I like the fact that I can adjust the loan to any way I see fit because I can make sure that my money is going into a very well adjust plan to help me out.",4
Jim,"Weatherford, OK","Reviewed July 23, 2018","I would suggest Quicken Loans to anyone that is in the housing market. At first all the paperwork was a huge hassle and took a long time. They were very detailed about my personal information too. They needed all my employment and tax information but that is pretty much standard. On the other hand, they have great customer service. Their agent was very friendly and helpful with all the major details. They said they could help me save thousands on my loan and they are doing exactly that. I enjoyed their approval of my loan at the best interest rate that I could afford. They also have very flexible easy payment plans.",5
Lynn,"Manitowoc, WI","Reviewed July 22, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans has been good. I like the idea that everything was either done over the phone or on the computer. They asked us which of our credit cards we wanted paid off and added that to our mortgage. Every step of the way they sent us either emails or phone calls to verify what they were doing. They did not ask lots of questions and we did not have much to do on our own. They did everything and then sent us all the paperwork to be signed. Additionally, our mortgage also saved us money on our credit cards so our credit scores can go up. We have also had a drop in our payments due to the fact our escrow was larger than needed so they are also honest. Everything went smoothly and quickly with the closing and is still going well as we speak. We know exactly what we owe and everything has gone well so far.",5
Kaylee,"Jonesboro, AR","Reviewed July 22, 2018","The process of getting a mortgage with Quicken Loans is... Painless. I particularly like the customer service. It is always great, and it's very easy to pay my mortgage, now. Quicken Loans does their job, for sure. But sometimes Quicken Loans can be a little slow on some things and you might have to have some patience. It took me a bit to get my mortgage, but it was better in the end. I am glad I have Quicken Loans at my back. It has been a nice experience and I have liked it so far.",4
Kevin,"Aurora, IL","Reviewed July 22, 2018","My experience has been acceptable, if a little underwhelming. I have been a customer of theirs for the past five years and I like the quality of the service. The process is quick and easy. Signing up for their website, I was subject to a credit check. Within seconds I was told that my credit was acceptable enough for a loan. I then spoke with an agent who walked me through the rest of the process. Overall, they have provided me with a service that works for me. I love them and would not entertain the notion of switching to any similar company.",5
Andrew,"Bronx, NY","Reviewed July 22, 2018","My experience was great. It was pretty streamlined. The people were very helpful and held my hand throughout the whole process. From valuable expertise to everything as a whole, they are certainly one of the better companies out there. I liked the way customer service helped me along the way. They were available 24/7 and whenever I needed help with a particular, they were there at the touch of my hand. The only real aspect I did dislike were sometimes the wait times were somewhat long. Not only that but the connection sometimes would fade in and out. There were a couple dropped calls but those rarely happened. But I liked how I could do some parts over the phone and over email. When I was getting ready to go to the bank, they would keep me updated every step of the way. I would recommend them to anyone.",5
Marie,"Inverness, FL","Reviewed July 22, 2018","My experience has been borderline satisfactory. My dissatisfaction with requiring an escrow account was changed to my satisfaction. Their insistence that I cancel some long term credit accounts when I did not want to because it would affect my credit cannot be rectified. I told them it would influence my credit rating and they said it would not. It did. There was no problem with my credit and the accounts had a zero balance. Additionally, there are several levels that you must go through and it is very aggravating. Even when you know something and explain it, it does not have much bearing on what they insist on you to comply. If you want to borrow, you have to jump through the hoops. I do not recommend Quicken to anyone and have restrained myself from disparging remarks to anyone else.",3
Anthony,"Hutchinson, KS","Reviewed July 22, 2018","Nice experience, really like their friendly service and competitive rates and also like how they do business and how they treat their customers.

Cameron,"Clinton, OK","Reviewed July 22, 2018",Basically you give all kinds of income tax forms and all employment information and also bank account statements. If you have any collateral to help get the loan it is always helpful in being successful at getting the best rates and loan. I have had a great experience with Quicken Loans. They have very reliable customer service and they are the best for getting the best loan rates. The people that work for Quicken Loans are very friendly and take care of all my loans and I am always able to reach and friendly voice when I call an agent. They help me with all my problems and concerns regarding my loans and I have never been treated bad by Quicken Loans. They are definitely a leader in their business field. I will definitely use them again in the future. I would recommend Quicken Loans to anyone who wants great prices and services. They need to be given the JD power award for great customer care.,5

Jacob,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Reviewed July 22, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans was very good to say the least. The process of getting a mortgage or loan with them was very simple and smooth to me. First all you need to do is apply for a loan of course. You can do this on your phone. After you applied you have some options to choose from, just find which choice best suits your need. After that you just need to verify your information. When that's done you just close out your loan. They give you about a thirty days to close on a house. Also, the minimum credit score you need is 580 even though my credit score is high, it's still good to know that you could have a score of 580 and still be able to use their services. Everything about Quicken Loans was great and I will recommend.",5
Bev,"Moberly, MO","Reviewed July 22, 2018","I called and got the information I needed, filled it out and sent it in, talked to the loan approval officer many times so that I could stay on top of what was going on, not that I needed to just that's how I am. I liked how easy it was to fill out the paperwork, how the loan officer helped explain things to me and helped me fill in any areas I needed help with. The approval process was in a easy timeframe I could work with. I disliked how much paperwork there was and the timeframe of approval. I am impatient and want the now solution to things, so that is a learner for me to wait. But all in all the process was in a timely fashion just all the information they want is a lot. Our loan officer helped with all that we needed to fill out and even some things I didn't understand they explained to me.

Tom,"Charleston, WV","Reviewed July 22, 2018",The company has been very easy to work with and it has been a pleasant experience. I liked how simple and easy it was to get the loan through them. We have experienced little to no problems and I liked that the process could be completed on the internet. The process was a lot less painful and tedious than I thought that it would be. It allowed us to decide without any major pressure. If I had to do it all over again I would still choose this company to work with above all others.,5
Peter,"Charlotte, NC","Reviewed July 22, 2018",It was pretty bad to be home best.

Lame cheaters shocking.,2
Justin,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed July 22, 2018",It has been a positive experience so far. The rates were competitive to others in the industry. They had kind and useful customer services. They were also courteous and very helpful all along the way. They keep in contact with me and my satisfaction. The process was easy to do. I obtained the quote online and entered in all my information on the web portal. I then used the rate calculator and compare tool to see what others offered and the differences in breakdown between the companies. I like the fact of how fast that they are in their quote process and how it was the same quote as when I finally ended up taking the offer on the mortgage they offered to me in the first place.,4

They were inept and getting paperwork done in a timely manner. Then they kept giving me the run around and was bouncing between different people. Then I was advised that the 3rd time they ran my credit was a soft inquiry. They were running my credit more times than they were supposed to. We were then told that the credit wasn't great because they ran it so many times.Their service after the loan compares to a cable company. They are very hard to deal with and constantly asking for more and more information. They were running my credit more times than they were supposed to.

I liked how easy the process was to find whatever it was I was looking for and how much they helped me find what I was looking for, and how nice they were was also helpful when I had to deal with them. But how high some of their rates were was like dealing with a personal finance company that have really high interest rates that take forever to pay back.

Every time I call or try to interact with people it is never a good time.,4
Sandra,"Scottsdale, AZ","Reviewed July 21, 2018",I thought Quicken Loans was not as good a Chase or any other bank but they turned out to be okay. My experience with them has been fine. I liked that I could call them and get a hold of them. They are easy to talk to or get a hold of. The interest rates are competitive to other loan companies or banks. The rest of their rates cost were the same or lower than the big banks or credit unions.,4
Meg,"Nc, Greensboro","Reviewed July 21, 2018","They have been really respectable and also have been honest with me. They have answered any questions that I have on mortgages and always been there for support. I liked that they are always fast and consistent. They answer the questions that I ask fully and are willing to walk me through the things that I need help with. I also like that it was easy to get all of my bills and all forms of my IDs that I needed so that the mortgage lenders could quickly and efficiently go over it in a timely manner. Although sometimes the customer service people could have better attitudes and could be a little more patient, I mostly have had a great experience with them and am overall pleased with them.",5
Maria,"Easthampton, MA","Reviewed July 21, 2018","After answering a few questions, a mortgage rep contacted me to discuss my options. We decided on a refinance and the process was streamlined and easy to access. The reps were upfront at each turn as to what I needed to do to qualify. Made it easy to obtain and submit all documentation needed in order to process the loan. My personal mortgage rep was very helpful in organizing my last refinance. We exchanged information and documents through email and fax, making the process as convenient as it possibly could. Then we had a rep come to the house to sign the documents and finalize the refinance. The timeline for closing was quick. I would definitely use Quicken Loans again, if I were to refinance. They were very professional and went out of their way to help me find an offer that suited my needs.",5
Jeff,"Virginia Beach, VA","Reviewed July 21, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans has been very fair, with no problems. The process of getting a mortgage with Quicken Loans was a very user-friendly and intuitive one. I simply filled out info on a website and got a response in a short amount of time. Very trustworthy. While I could probably get better rates elsewhere, you can't beat no hassle and quickness. I would recommend this service to my friends and co-workers.",5
Michael,"Huntington, WV","Reviewed July 21, 2018",The process was really quick. I just called in to them on the phone and the next day I had an agent wanting me to come in and see them and get started on what I wanted to have done and whatever else they could help with. I had a great experience with Quicken Loans. They did everything I needed them to do and faster than I thought they would be able to do it. They was really nice about everything with me and even helped when they didn’t have to.,5
Jasmine,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed July 21, 2018","We applied online and it was a seamless process and everyone has been extremely helpful in our home buying process.

Sandra,"Chicora, PA","Reviewed July 21, 2018","Everything was well beyond what I expected. Everyone was very friendly and didn't try to push anything on you. And they worked very closely with you to help the process much easier. Plus, the process was very quick. I applied for the loan online and had a call within an hour. I was told that I was approved and how much. That was the best part. They appointed a real estate person to help me with locating houses for sale. After that was just a matter of finding a house I wanted and then DID all the paperwork.",5
Ace,"Fremont, CA","Reviewed July 21, 2018","The loan officer who helped me was very kind and walked me through each and every step in detail.

They did a good job and I would do it again.",4
Sarita,"Jeannette, PA","Reviewed July 21, 2018",The experience has been up and down. The process was long and dragged out. They give you the runaround on a lot of subjects and on top of that they charge of Fortune in fees. I didn't like that they take advantage of their customers in every way possible and they tend to screw their customers over a lot. The interest rate is also very high and rarely worth it. There are other companies that would do a more satisfactory job. I would never recommend Quicken Loans to anybody.,1
Kevin,"Omaha, NE","Reviewed July 21, 2018","When you first come into contact they are good at telling you about what they do and how they can help you out with your mortgage. They are very good at providing good customer service and have a good track record for me when it comes to their services. You will first need to examine what types of rates that you can get elsewhere in order to be able to compare with Quicken. Well it is a lot of research at first but then once you get in you can get things done fairly quickly and it goes fast from there. They are pretty quick to provide services and seem to have low rates, but at times I have wondered about how they go about finding their sources and how they get into contact with certain industries. If I could choose to just go through one client then things would be easier but at times I see a lot of different hands in there. Sometimes they are slow in responding but when it comes to things I do not like it is more of a general sense of worry.",3
P,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed July 21, 2018","Excellent service, easy to navigate website, many options, competitive interest rates and timely processing of our payments. However, there were a few too many unsolicited telephone calls and weekly mailings that were trying to get us to purchase financial products that were not related to the mortgage or refi. Overall, the simplicity of the whole process of getting the mortgage, and later the refi, was great... They sent the notary to our house, very easy process all the way around.",4
Adila,"Washington, DC","Reviewed July 21, 2018","My experience was actually quite nice. They helped me with everything I needed to know and plus I felt extremely prepared. They were extremely nice to me and they helped me with everything I needed to get done without me feeling overpowered and overwhelmed. I was very happy with my experience. I liked the aspect about it being easy because you are not working hard and I actually built a friendship with my advisor. However, I felt like it took longer than I was expecting it to which threw me through a loop because I only expected a couple weeks but it was actually months of waiting. But overall it was quite easy and enjoyable to do business with them.",5
Wanda,"New Palestine, IN","Reviewed July 21, 2018","Competitive rates, professional personnel. I liked talking to the associates on the phone. They were pleasant, easy to chat with and responsive to questions and concerns. They actually listened to me. It is a personable experience. I was offered several financing options and that was nice. Software interfaces with my home computer as well. At one time I couldn't decide if I was actually going to refinance or not. I did receive almost daily calls from different people asking if I was ready. So it seemed a little pushy. Nevertheless, I would recommend them to my friends.",5
John,"Bronx, NY","Reviewed July 21, 2018",The things I liked about my experience with Quicken Loans were their attention to detail and the amount of time they put into assuring I get the best price possible.

Thomas,"Kansas City, MO","Reviewed July 20, 2018","They offer great rates and make the approval process easy. The billing process is painless and bills are always on time and accurate. I feel like an individual instead of just another application. I never once felt lost in the shuffle. I was always informed about where I was in the process and what was going on and which steps would come next. They took the time to know my situation and my exact needs/wants from the mortgage as well as my abilities to repay. Additionally, I loved that I could do the application online. I also appreciated the quick response on Quicken's end.",5
Santos,"Orlando, FL","Reviewed July 20, 2018","Quicken Loans is a good company. It's well known and great customer service, and has good interest rate. The process of getting a mortgage loan from them is very easy. They work with you and help you when you need them and solve problems quick. However, the fees could be a little bit lower. I seen other company with lower fees. But other than that they are reliable and also knowledgeable. I would recommend this company.",5
Ashley,"Alexandria, VA","Reviewed July 20, 2018",Employees were very helpful with the process and patient with me. Their employees are trained very well and know how to add a personal touch with working with customer. Their customer service is amazing and they genuinely care about helping customer.

Kristina,"Point Pleasant, WV","Reviewed July 20, 2018","Quicken has great rates and I was never felt pressured to sign or agree to anything I wasn't comfortable with. The customer service is beyond exceptional, easy to deal with and can always give a helpful response when needed. They have very friendly employees and I liked that they really took the time to go over everything. One thing I would change about the company would be to have more offices around and in closer proximity to me. Also to include shorter wait times when calling in to speak to a representative. Nevertheless, Quicken Loans is a good company to work with and cares about its customers. Have never had an issue and would recommend them to anyone.",4
Amiyah,"Bakersfield, CA","Reviewed July 20, 2018","My experience was great. The service was impeccable and the staff was excellent. They were extremely kind and they knew what they were doing. The service was also fast and they helped me through the whole time. It was very easy and I never really got stressed out. I definitely recommend Quicken Loans to everyone who is looking for a mortgage loan for sure first choice. If I haven't have picked them I feel like I would've been super stressed out not to mention they are extremely affordable. Quicken Loans is very underrated and people all around the world should try them and see how it goes. They are nice, kind and very welcoming for new people. I must admit I was scared at first but once they started to welcome me I knew I had made the right choice.",5
Barbara,"Stamford, CT","Reviewed July 20, 2018","The experience has been satisfying. I'm very pleased with their services. Their professionalism is comparable to their standards. I wish that more companies would follow their training measures. I also feel that they treat me like a family member. I get the best rates and always come put ahead.

They had me in their interest all along and I felt it.",5
Melissa,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed July 20, 2018",My experience with Quicken Loans has been excellent. They provided a very easy process to use online and to apply. The response time was very fast and I was approved very quickly. You start off with going to the website and hitting the apply button. You fill out the application and I really liked how easy it was to o. Then they get back to you within days if you are approved or not. You get the amount you are approved for the loan and the information about what kind of plan and interest is available.

Loved the support team. I also like how awesome they were. They helped me with everything and anything. I would totally do business with them again. They had a super informative employee. However, I did dislike how long it took to approve my loan. It kinda delayed my business startup and I did dislike how one of the employees had an attitude with me and was staring at me.

I recommend and would use them again.",5
Pat,"Palm Harbor, FL","Reviewed July 20, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans has been relatively positive for a mortgage company. The process of getting a mortgage from them can be very fast or long and thought out, it just depends on the amount of research that you do into the mortgage process and finding what is the best option for you. For me, personally, I would have like more human interaction during the process to be more confident in my decisions and have a sounding board to bounce ideas off of. ",4
John,"Santa Ana, CA","Reviewed July 20, 2018","They been such a good service to me. I always get what I want because they know what I want.

They also give me discount if something goes wrong and they will do it right next time. But I dislike how sometime the wait list are very long. Sometime they don't give me discount and sometime they do it all random. I dislike how some of the service take very long just to respond back.

Scott,"Inverness, FL","Reviewed July 20, 2018","The process of obtaining a mortgage through Quicken Loans is very simple. First they ask you to submit a loan application then it is submitted for approval after verifying your credit. Once approved your application is forwarded to a loan officer for further review and approval. They are a very professional company and have a customer comes first philosophy. Their customer service and loan agents are very helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. Quicken Loans has handled my business very well over the years and I would recommend them to anyone.

I was approved quickly too. I like that they are easy to work with. I also make my payments online and when I have a question, that can be taken care of online. The payments are reasonable enough but the term agreement is not very long. So it is a toss up on how well to like it.",3
Kelly,"Elba, AL","Reviewed July 20, 2018","I have seen a lot of advertising for Quicken Loans. All of the information I heard is worth considering. The interest rate is competitive so payments would be affordable. However, even though Quicken Loans is a competitive lender, the television commercials are somewhat on the less than professional side. I believe it is most important to always keep a highly professional appearance with the public when a lender is making an appeal to the public.",3
Judy,"San Marcos, TX","Reviewed July 20, 2018","Quicken Loans is a very good company. I liked it when we first refinanced with Quicken because they were so easy to deal with. We did almost everything by mail. They have a wonderful website that will tell you anything that you want to know about your loan or the history of your loan. They have excellent customer service too. They are very proactive in everything they do. They are always there if you have a problem and try to help you. If the interest rates go down, they contact you and try to lower your payment. They have been there for us the whole way. However, they now go by Rocket Mortgage, and I can't understand why.",5
Jack,"Newaygo, MI","Reviewed July 19, 2018",Everything was spelled out right from the beginning. People were easy to deal with and all paperwork was sent online without having to really meet anyone for the loan. The payments were easy to make online too and there were no hidden fees. But then the rates kept changing. Would go up with no reason at all. Had to finally get another loan cause of the high interest rate. They didn't cooperate very well when I was trying to refinance. For a fast and easy to apply to loan I would recommend Quicken Loans until you can get a better rate.,3
Karen,"Nashville, TN","Reviewed July 19, 2018",When we decided refinance our home we checked several companies and decided to go with Quicken Loans. I was a little worried it wouldn't be a good idea but we went ahead and did it. They're a very honest company. No game playing. They did what they would do and always did a good job of keeping us informed. But it would be nice to pick the day you pay due to when we get paid. We want it to be auto pay on the 7th and they will not do it. Other than that I have been very happy so far and it has been over a year. We will use them again if we needed to. The process was smooth and easy and we enjoyed it. We would recommend Quicken Loans to family and friends.,5

We only needed a small loan to do what we needed done and while we got the loan, we gave it a lot of thought and decided not to accept it.

They also produced the results that they said they would, thus making me an extremely satisfied customer with absolutely not one complaint.

They kept in contact with us at all times. They explained things if we didn't understand them. All employees were courteous.

Instead of wet signing all documents, I was able to sign with a click of a button. However I dislike how the rates were higher than what some other banks were offering. I understand with advertising these type of companies. Need to boost rates to cover for overhead. I am ok with that, as I can refinance down to a lower rate when that time comes.",3

However, the process of getting set up on bimonthly payments has not been one that has worked for me. But the refinancing process was seamless and simple.

There was a time there was a problem with their system and for some reason my payments were not being posted so I had to settle this but with the help of my friend, the problem was solved in just a few hours.

They know what customers need and go beyond that to accomplish a goal. They care about their customers. They are compassionate and understand hardships. However the prices could be cheaper. Also, getting the loan could be easier. There is too much red tape and they need less paperwork since no one likes doing them. When I applied for a loan, they needed my W2s, tax forms and pay stubs and then they had a lot of paperwork to fill out. Then once approved, there were still many papers to sign and more paperwork.

I just learned four years later that they were not going to return my money. I've read this is a common complaint. When I started with Quicken I refinanced with a $5000 cash out. I only received $3300 of that and they ran circles around me in explanation. I later learned the remainder was being held in Pennsylvania unclaimed property due to their error with chase bank. There was never proper assistance with these problems. Please don't even talk to him. They will chase you. You will regret it. Read the other complaints. Use a credit union.,1
Reid,"Sanford, NC","Reviewed July 18, 2018","I contacted company about a refinance. From the beginning I should have knew something was up, because I was treated more like a number than a person. Nothing is as streamlined as they claimed. I was told I needed to make a certain amount which I do when my shift premium is counted. We told them from the start that the shift premium would show on the paycheck statement but not on the employment verification because it’s not a part of my base pay. So we were pre-approved and strung along for two weeks when they called and said that the shift premium was not on the employment verification. We told them several times it wouldn’t be, but they didn’t listen at all. We told them to stop wasting our time and walked away. Currently we are working with a different lender for a refinance and it’s moving smoothly. Quicken Loans, will never have my business and I would not recommend them to anyone.",1

It didn't take that long as I expected and I was able to get my house as soon as possible. However, I disliked that I had to wait in the office for so long. I just wished I could've done everything on the phone. I like how the people were very cooperative and reasonable for the prices and how much they gave me. I also like that they let me pick the date I wanted to pay them back by. I am very grateful for them and I have even told friends and family about it. I think everyone should use it if they want something done quickly.",4

Michelle,"Duluth, GA","Reviewed July 18, 2018","It has been pretty great and inexpensive. I enjoyed how quick people responded to my concerns and I loved them for it. I really think everyone needs it in their lives if they have a house or car that has not been paid off. However, if there was a better live chat then more people wouldnt leave bad reviews so quickly and they would get their problems resolved quicker. Also, the process was very long but it was worth it. The quality was amazing and everyone who uses it loves it. Not too many steps in the process so it is not too much work. I would recommend it to any of my friends because it is that good quality. If my friends ask I will tell them to use it for mortgages.",4
Sherri,"Akron, OH","Reviewed July 18, 2018","When I originally got my loan through Quicken Loans I was refinancing from another company to get a lower interest rate. I did get that lower interest rate and I was happy about that. It was fine until I started to go into default on my loan then they were rather pushy. Constant letters, emails and phone calls. Even though I had worked out a plan with them they still harassed me for want of a better word. However, the things I liked about Quicken Loans, was the reduction in paperwork. That was probably the most important. The interest rate was second. But I wasn't real happy about the PMI Insurance. It took 5 years to get that taken off but eventually it came off. ",3

After submitting a complete application with all of the requested and required documentation they returned an approval for a 20 year mortgage. I told them I wanted a 30 year mortgage and that In my history as a loan officer I had never once done a 20 year mortgage. The 20 year mortgage would only lower my payment $84 a month and was going to cost me $7000 to do the refinance. Obviously, only a fool and a sucker would accept this predatory offer.

Among other requirements, you have to send a voided check for the account. Even if it is a business check it must have your name on it. The tech said to simply have the bank print a few with my name on it in addition to my company name. However, when I did this, I found that there was a ""secret rule"" that even the tech was unaware of. These checks were unacceptable because they were ""counter checks"" printed by the bank. Has been weeks of stubborn trying to get account accepted. Support calls back with blocked number so I don't answer. They leave a voice message with a number.

Jess,"Elkhorn, WI","Reviewed March 19, 2018","I recently attempted to refinance my home through Quicken Loans. My initial mortgage broker was helpful and encouraging when he asked me what I thought my home was worth. Based on a refinance amount of my outstanding loans (2) of just under $160,000 we aimed for an appraised value of $205,000. This would cover my closing costs. In other words Quicken/Rocket would roll them into the loan. This was acceptable to me, so I agreed. I was asked to put up the $500.00 ""good faith"" money. I complied. The appraiser came out, did his appraisal and submitted to Quicken/Rocket. It came in at $200,000. Enough to pay off my existing mortgage, but not the approximate $4,400 in closing costs, which was now my #1 option. Which, it never was because I told my Rep., we are retired, and I do not have that kind of money to bring to closing. ",1
Robin,"Seaford, NY","Reviewed March 17, 2018","I was contacted 3/10/18 by an employee Billy after ignoring calls in the past. I told him I did not qualify for a refinance. Since a few months back I filed for bankruptcy. I asked him specifically not to run my credit because I was trying to reestablish it. They had my info from the past and in spite of my request they ran it. Which brought down my score that I've been trying to reestablish. I was notified by a Fraud Alert from Trans Union by text that evening letting me know that my credit was looked into by a 3rd party through Quicken Loans. Regardless that these calls are supposedly taped, after complaining to an Andrew in their Detroit office he agreed he heard me tell this Billy NOT to RUN my credit that I didn't qualify but that Billy was able to. So for a Company to do that in spite of what I requested I would BEWARE. Who knows what they would say or do for your signature.",1

If she bought a wedding dress would she buy it from her couch, no she would go to the store. She replied, “I don’t like to shop in person”. I’m thinking, wow she is mad and patronizing.

Jeremy,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed March 13, 2018","I had an absolutely terrible experience with Quicken Loans. I had to repeatedly tell them no as they tried to use high pressure sales tactics to push me into a loan I didn't want with Lender-Paid MI. They refused to provide any loan estimates in writing or take no for an answer, so I told them I was done with their BS and hanging up. They continued to try to call me repeatedly and I had to block their number. Then they tried to call my wife. I would not recommend Quicken Loans to anybody based on this experience. Also, based on the numbers they had the worst deals out of all the lenders I talked to. Their rates weren't particularly competitive and their points were expensive. They wanted to charge over $6000 in points to get to a competitive rate and started us at par instead of giving us any discount on rate for good credit (780+).",1

When I finally got the rates they were not competitive at all compared to other institutions. When I challenged them on this... They tried to give me a lot of nonsense about why they are better and that their fees for closing were so much less, which when I asked a lot of questions, they really are not.",1

The more information we gave them, the more information they wanted. We were extremely frustrated that the process took so long. Would like to sever my relationship with them. The people I talked with are friendly but are basically powerless to solve my problem. In other words, there is too much micromanaging and not enough delegation. Also, sometimes hard to understand customer service representative. And I didn't like its idiot lawyers giving us a hard time over our Chapter 13 where we are paying Quicken directly instead of through the court.

I like the fast way they lend you the money but at the same time there's a monthly payment to be made and is taken directly from the bank.

However, as this was well before 60 days to the closing date that I wanted, the commitment letter stated that it was not the final letter because they needed one final paystub within 60 days of closing.

They pulled my credit reports and ran a credit check to determine what interest rate I would get on the mortgage loan. It was a great rate and I couldn't ask for a better rate.

The process was very simple and they called me to switch to 15 year mortgage. They called me to offer me the opportunity to save money in the long run if I could afford higher monthly payment which I did.

I was also very satisfied with the loan terms and the interest rate. We were approved in under 10 minutes. We used their rocket mortgage service and it worked as advertised.

It was frustrating at times as there is no face-to-face person to talk to, but otherwise OK once the loan was closed.

Then I looked at reviews on a message board and decided it would be good for me to work with them. Then I went back to their website and applied. I liked how easy it was to find out information on their website. They really worked with me to handle my account. They were always courteous to me over the phone. I got the impression that they really cared about me and my family. However, at times it seemed like it take a long time to get a callback or I would be put on hold for a long time. I don't want to seem impatient but it would have been nice to hear back sooner.",4

You make a phone call to get the process started, provide a few documents electronically and in a short amount of time person arrives at your home for signatures and you're done.

I have liked everything about my experiences with Quicken and I would definitely use them again.",5

James,"Villa Park, IL","Reviewed March 4, 2018",Quicken Loans being able to refinance my home at any price range with no problem while saving a bit of money in the process is one thing I liked about them. But it's been hit and miss with them and refinancing. Took days with the representative to settle a agreement and abstain a quote from them. Wish it didn't take so long. They were asking for a lot of my personal information with many paperwork and letters being sent through the mail and having virtually no privacy at all with this company. But they're great when it comes to paying for my home no matter the price range.,3

They made everything very possible to read. I liked the very quick way they handled my application. Very simple and easy directions. They make a point of making the customer happy and with less hassles to worries off your shoulders. Less work than other places and less paperwork to deal with. I don't see anything at all confusing about this loan services. As with any company I do not like having to write out my name so many times. Feel like your signing the same papers. I would say the long lines I know I don't like. Bring down the long line lines to truly have a great experience.,5
Lynn,"Houston, TX","Reviewed March 3, 2018","My experience with Quicken Loans was positive. The process was simple and straightforward. They gave me 3 names of companies and it was up to me then to decide which one I would utilize. From there it went smoothly and I got my house refinanced. Their representatives are very helpful. At different times when I have called them they were knowledgeable enough to know whether refinancing was a good thing for me at that time or not. One time that I called them it was a good time to refinance and we proceeded to do that. I have been contemplating calling them again since the rates are still low. They have quality partners and one should have no problem choosing a reputable company to do their business with. And every time I have called them they have been quick to let me know if they could help me or not. There was not any of this ""let me check "" and stringing you along.",5
Renard,"Fayetteville, NC","Reviewed March 3, 2018",I had a mortgage with Quicken Loans and the service was excellent and professional to the letter with a great interest rate.

Olivia,"Homestead, FL","Reviewed March 3, 2018","It was good and an easier process than most places.

Otherwise, confident in what they have experience and workforce they do plus it was a great experience for me and had a nice person to talk and ask questions to. It was a great day and I will be satisfied if they it short and simple in their terms and policies and if they keep the same routines in everything and everyday in the workforce.",3
Will,"College Park, MD","Reviewed March 3, 2018","It has been a great experience in dealing with this company.

I like that there is a variety of options available to the buyer in regards to refinancing and equity. Everything from customer service and the options mentioned are all to my liking. These options make this company one of the best to deal with in regards to loans and a variety of other products. Also, the process was not time-consuming and was very quick. Most the time, depending on what is happening, it usually takes no more than an hour to get everything settled. I will continue to use Quicken Loans in the near future for all my loan needs.",5

But they need like a texting app to show how much you've paid on your monthly balance and how much is that I owed stuff. It'd be a great process and I think that they would make more money if they would just to have an app to show every transaction payment agreement. Quicken Loans is okay. You just pay back what you borrowed which is right. I like them. A lot damage from the other companies and Quicken Loans actually build up your credit which is great. But the company is pretty much hideous and you have to pay more than what you borrow. It's actually kind of ridiculous the company wants you to borrow money for what you need it for and then they want you to pay back 40% interest which ain't right.,3

I just wasted 3 days with these morons, finally someone calls me and says we are good for funding today, I just need to log back in and accept my terms while I'm on the phone with him. So I do that and literally while I'm on the phone the site says, ""We're sorry but we can't offer you a loan at this time."" What???? Even the loan officer on the phone was confused.

Nevertheless, the process of getting a mortgage was simple because everything could be done online, from the application to the paperwork to the approval. The staff at Quicken Loans are easy to work with too. They were upfront about what information was needed.

I never could access the 'personal loan web page' and always had to have an online chat with someone completely different.

Also, the phone calls were overly extreme. I did however feel that the customer service reps that I spoke to were very nice and helpful though there was just way too many of them. They need to somehow simplify the process, make it faster and easier to get. And less phone calls would also be a benefit.

Quickens Loans sounded like they were going to be honest and sincere dealing with the entire process. But the experience I had with Quickens Loans was far less than desirable. It doesn't appear that Quickens Loans follows through on the total process. It would appear either they are less than professional in dealing with the paperwork or work with nondisclosure of vital information. I was forced to pay for a property survey simply because Quickens Loans wanted extended coverage on the mortgage. ,1

I liked the overall response time they had to my inquiries from the very beginning. They are one of the most premium services in receiving information that you provide. The only thing I would say is they respect being up front in your inquiries and giving your honest feedback in what they can do to make the experience better.",5

I couldn't help but think I would prefer doing it this way to any other way I have seen or heard on tv. I had absolutely no trouble in using and navigating the interface but can see how others might have. Quicken Loans could make it slightly easier to navigate and installation of the programs. Also, make it easier to find in stores. I would pay more for more versions of Quicken Loans. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",4
Ashley,"Woodstock, GA","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2018","Their program stated that their FHA lending starts at 580, the middle score the man gave to my fiancé was 620, which is what they work off of- everything else was good- when it came to the exact house, my fiancé had no idea what to tell him because he hadn't looked yet, only wanted to know what he was prequalified for. Long story shorter, this ** from Quicken pulled my fiancé's credit just to DECLINE him ""because he needs more money in the bank"". He didn't know what he has or we have in the bank?!?! Stay away and find a local lender that has personal skills and can have a real conversation on the phone.

Brandon,"Altadena, CA","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2018","I really liked Quicken Loans. They are really fast and helped me with my mortgage by giving me the money and only taking a small interest fee, which was 1.2 percent. I talked to a rep and then they gave me my not so hard earned money that I just asked them to give me. It was really easy. However, I disliked that they even have a interest. They should just give me money because that would be the nice thing to do so that they keep customers and maybe they could squeak some money out of them by being like, ""Hey I need some money because of our no interest rates.""",5

Tim,"Randolph, MA","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2018",Obtaining a mortgage from Quicken Loans or anywhere would takes a lot of time just like anywhere else. I started by researching online and asking for feedback from other folks. It takes some effort to communicate and open dialogues. The least appealing process is gathering paper works together.

They were very transparent and made it less intimidating through the entire process of getting a mortgage. Their support was very friendly to deal with. I would absolutely do business again with them in the future.,5

The first step is signing a lot of papers and you have to get a copy of your driving license and a lot of other stuff personal.

The agents at Quicken Loans were very helpful with the process of handling issues that we were or were not aware of when considering buying a home. This was our first loan for a house and it was a positive experience to say the least. Also the sellers were there for us to address our questions and concerns. All in all it was handled in a professional manner from beginning to closing. However, I really disliked and was kind of surprised that they can sell our loan to another company without our consent. I didn't really care for the way we had to take off work to finish the closing process. But I guess that is part of the steps or process that needed to be handled in a certain time frame. Also, being the first time applying for a loan I wouldn't exactly say it was simple, but learned things going through the process. So it was worthwhile.",3

Kimberly,"Bluff City, TN","Reviewed Feb. 21, 2018","I agree with the other review that says ""I should have just cut and pasted everyone else's review"". I was misled from the beginning by ""Sam"" who spoke very fast and seemed annoyed at my questions prior to pulling my credit. After telling him about receipts I could not provide, he checked with his ""underwriter friend"" and assured me everything was okay. After jumping through hoops and getting document after document in a timely manner, and scheduling an appointment with the appraiser, I was told by someone else that I didn't have documents that were crucial to closing this loan. The same documents I told Sam up front that I could not provide. What is the benefit from misleading people? Would not use again and will tell everyone I know not to use them either.

My experience with Quicken Loans was in fact a very positive experience. One negative about the entire experience was the wait times that one must endure in order to speak with a representative; however, it's a small price to pay when the representatives themselves are so helpful with one's particular situation.

Isaac,"Waldorf, MD","Reviewed Jan. 28, 2018",I've had a bad experience while attempting to refinance in the past and finally opened up to the idea of trying to refinance my home again. I put my trust with Quicken Loans and avoided offers from other mortgage companies. I believed they were a reputable mortgage company until I stumbled across these reviews. I got a loan to make some repairs under the advisement from their mortgage experts so that these repairs would help in increasing my appraisal but some of this information was misleading. I was told I had to pay the appraisal fee upfront in Good Faith and that I should recover the money back at settlement.,1

I am getting a small home improvement loan to enlarge and improve my lovely California home. First I spoke to Justin, then Jorden, then he was on vacation and I spoke to another kid. Just ridiculous. In any case now I am working with a local lender. All fees upfront, no hidden costs etc. Perfect credit and I have bought and sold 15 homes in my 65 year old life.

Then a week before the escrow closes, they changed the points to 2.125 so I terminated the loan and went with someone else.

I felt that was information that should have been disclosed to me up front so that I can decide if I wish to proceed. Knowing all the facts makes all the difference and I felt Quicken Loans was unfair. I filed a complaint with their resolution advocate and wouldn't you know it, my request for reimbursement was denied.

This indicated value of less than 50K under previous appraisal done less than 1 month before.

I have a credit score of 810, own my current home outright, no debt, and have substantial investment income. I clearly told the rep I would be listing my house for sale after buying a new home; as it's paid off, there's no rush, and I'm in an area of the country where houses can take months or even a year or more to sell. Based on the rep's statements and pre-approval letter, I found a home and made a purchase offer, setting a closing date, which was accepted. I scheduled the home inspection. I was then told by Quicken that I would have to (a) sell my current home before a mortgage would be approved, and (b) I'd have to have a floating rate. Both were explicit contradictions of what I was told during the application process.",1

Penny,"Port Richey, FL","Reviewed Oct. 26, 2017",I read a few reviews online about Quicken Loans and thought no way it would be fine. Boy was I wrong. Not only do you give a GOOD FAITH deposit of $500.00 that is (not) refundable so they say you do all the legwork for them then when it is time to close they tell you they can't do it oh and you're not getting your money back cause they used it to pay for the appraisal and the amount of the loan magically goes up 10-15 thousand more than what you want oh and the best part you're locked in interest is not the same as they say it is. I don't recommend this company at all. Go somewhere else try a credit union they work better and a cheaper interest rate too. If you use this company you're going to get screwed and will not enjoy it and they won't even cuddle with you. Either rob the poor to make the rich richer.,1

I am not interested in doing that, but was curious about what he could offer. Frankly, I wasn’t impressed with his terms. During the call he said several times, ""We’re going to pay off your car loan and your dentist and send you $4,000 from your equity."" I thought Quicken Loans must really want my business badly to do that, but I was skeptical. Finally, I pinned him down on the issue and he admitted the dentist payment would be paid from my equity and Quicken Loans would pay off my car as a loan to me.

Darren,"Missoula, MT","Reviewed April 26, 2017","Where do I start. Do not even think of using Quicken Loans. They are so incompetent and so unprofessional, they approved me 3 times and denied me 3 times. They should not have a license to do mortgages. I spent 20k paying off bills. Sending 100ds of documents 30 days ago. I was so pissed off with their lack of professionalism I checked reviews and oh my god it was terrible, but I stuck with it and now it's been another month or more and now they denied me again over crap that they misled me on. And I must be a fool for falling for it, when I read the reviews and the same stupidity is what I'm facing, don't listen to a couple of positive reviews. The bad far outweighs the fake good reviews. Tell everyone!!! And don't stop until they are out of business. They will wreck your life. Money is no joke. They might as well be a Ponzi scheme.",1
Jim,"Largo, FL","Reviewed April 24, 2017","The reason I gave them three stars is that the Loan Officer I dealt with during the process was great and helpful during my whole home purchasing experience. Then after I found something and started the loan process it got transferred to someone else. Then the ** starts. This is the part where you should start realizing that something may be wrong. I didn't and kept going. They asked for all the normal information which is customary but then things turned. When they asked me for something a little out of the ordinary, I got it for them immediately and was told they would send it to underwriting for approval. Remember that is only the first item. Now underwriting that is suppose to be right there ISN'T! It took days for it to get back so we could move on. Then we did the next thing which was normal on a P & S but underwriting in their own wisdom and without question changed it. This took a week to resolve. ",3

I'm being penalized for putting 20% down. The loan officer starts asking for a $500 deposit and to sign an intent to proceed form. DO NOT PAY IT! I told him I need to shop around because he has no clue what is going on. I now have to pay another 2-3K in closing costs. I'm worried it could double or triple. I've been lied to so much and I haven't even gone to underwriting! This is mortifying. Goodbye Quicken, I'll use my local lender. You guys are an absolute disgusting mess.",1

We just needed to go to the website and start an application. The most tedious thing was securing paper copies of documents. They then sent a document specialist to our home when it was time to sign for the loan. Their website is easy to navigate so paying our mortgage is quick and painless. I would recommend them. The only thing I didn't like about the whole process is having to provide paper copies of past tax returns and pay stubs. I found that funny since it was a digital process for everything else.,5

We needed a mortgage company that would approve us and Quicken seemed to have the best rate and overall higher rating options. We looked at the paperwork and decided that it was worth it and seemed like a good process. It was very simple, that even I could understand it. It was easy, not confusing at all and fairly quick in terms of response time. The paperwork was right there in front of you so if there was a problem you could ""ask"" questions and somebody did actually get back to you. We filled out the paperwork together but I really did not like the fact that we basically had to tell them our life story so that was a little disconcerting to me but otherwise it was okay. I like the approval process and the amount of time it took us to be approved.",4

Usually getting a mortgage with a good rate can become a drag, but not with Quicken Loans. They have great rates and are efficient in finding the best mortgage for you. The agents are informative but need to slow down while working with a client to make the consumer feel like a person rather than a number. It did not feel personal, but they were detail oriented and made the process pleasant. There was a bit of confusion and miscommunication, however the agent did their best to break everything down so it was clear and simple.",4

The process was quick and easy and I was surprisingly very pleased with the service.

I shopped other loans and got a much better rate and deal than I did with Quicken. I went with the other lender. The person I was dealing with at Quicken went crazy. Calling repeatedly and hanging up, leaving threatening voicemails, sending threatening text messages. I finally had to fire off a cease all contact or else email to get it to stop. After this experience and seeing other reviews on here, I feel like I dodged a bullet. Three weeks before closing on my new house and everything is ready with my lender.

Jean,"Portage, MI","Reviewed April 20, 2017","I had a negative experience when dealing with Quicken. While they are right on trying to get a mortgage for you, they tend to play dumb when things get complicated. When we were first contacted they made us feel important and not just another deal. But as soon as there is a glitch they just say, ""Sorry, call back when you do this or that."" They get our hopes up about refinancing but then since we don't have an adequate heating system to their standards, we did not qualify for it. While I didn't get the results I thought I would, they were empathetic. It is simple to go through Quicken but at the same time, one never knows who they will match you up with. This is where they need to improve their services.",2

They screwed up everything they could possibly screw up. They asked us to upload documents 3 and 4 times that we had already uploaded.

While it may be compared to a local lender, it was stressful and seemed to take forever!

There are many things that I liked with respect to my business with Quicken Loans since it is a responsible company and with quite reasonable credit rates with respect to other companies.

Sometimes the system is usually a bit slow, which makes me stress in those times when I work under pressure and I need a quick response from this provider.

We were upset because it was going to cost an estimated $150 more to update it when completed. Said that wasn't true, but we went ahead because we were afraid we would miss our interest rate lock in.

There was lots and lots of paperwork and whenever we faxed something to them, we would have to follow-up to make sure not only had they received it but were they acting on the additional information. Quicken Loans was not particularly responsive. We had to continually call and follow-up with them to keep the process moving.",2
Jillian,"Framingham, MA","Reviewed April 15, 2017","I really enjoy quicken loans and they helped me through the process, which was simple and easy. I was so nervous since I didn't even know if I would qualify. They kept in touch and explained everything. I chose to get my mortgage with them because of the experience I had. I like all the online communication and signing, which were great. Feel very informed by getting statements and updates about my account. My QL is easy to use and has all of the information I need. Great customer service. Dealing with different people for different parts of the process. I enjoyed working with my first contact but then had 2 or 3 others later in the process. Though they were good too it wasn't the same personalized experience and found myself calling the first individual a lot as I didn't know which person to call anymore.",5
Patrick,"Buena Park, CA","Reviewed April 15, 2017","Quicken Loans provides excellent features on property mortgages such as fixed or adjustable rates loans, mortgage financing, FHA and VA loans. The customer services and account representative are extremely helpful and provides sound advising. I like the Rocket loans features which provides instant approval to loans online for mortgages, fixed or adjustable rate loans are awesome. After the addition of Rocket loans it has become more formidable and have dominated the Home loans and mortgage industry. It was fairly easy since using rocket loans you can apply online for any kind of loan you prefer and there is ample support and financial advising provided by tech support or live chat representatives. These are the best features which Quicken Loans have added recently. I have liked the experience working with Quicken Loans and I would recommend it to friends and family. Great, amazing, peaceful and awesome.",5

It's a huge company and heard a lot of great reviews from other personal experiences. They helped me gather the information and collected different data, quotes and prices that really made a difference in today's economic website than any other mortgage lenders. It was time-consuming to provide the information but yet again it would be the same as doing it in person. They were professional and everything was done by computer. If needed help a chat was always available. I didn't have a hard time understanding the concepts. Everything was right in front of you. I didn't even have to call customers service. Everything was done by chat. It was convenient for me not to get out of the house and apply from different banks.",5
Brianna,"Barstow, CA","Reviewed April 14, 2017",They didn't hassle me about much and the staff was kind and friendly which made me comfortable about my decision to go with them.

They had a lot of patience with me as I had a lot of patience with them. Everything worked out great. The process was fast and efficient. I was so happy with the final results. If I had troubles I would consider them again. I have dealt with others in the past but none of them compared to Quicken Loans. They are the best.,5
Chris,"Bartow, FL","Reviewed April 14, 2017",Experience was exceptional and very easy to get the loan. This company was very helpful and laid out step by step procedure for the whole process. I would recommend this company to anyone to needing a loan. Very easy to use online or app. It has everything at your fingertips to start and finish your home loan needs. Also very easy to get help when using the app or being online using customer help tabs. Even when I call the direct line for assistance they was right there to assist. I liked the fact that they explain and walk you through everything that you need to know. They was able to have answers for all of my questions that I've asked. Might be a little slower at getting back or returning a phone call occasionally however that seemed to be a small issue in comparison.,5

Their process was very easy and I did the application in person in front of their people who know very well the system of the company. Making a business with this company was great and I will continue with them.,4
Lee,"Woodbridge, VA","Reviewed April 14, 2017","I read reviews about Quicken Loans and asked all my friends, coworkers, and family about them. Then I got a few quotes from them and they were equitable to other companies so I went with them. I applied online and then followed up with phone calls. The initial loan process was easy.

Then I contacted them five other times after that until the loan was approved and paid out to me. ",4

Allison,"Asbury Park, NJ","Reviewed April 14, 2017","Quicken Loans was very responsive to inquiries and were able to get you necessary information in a timely manner. Contacting your representative was a clear process as well. Getting a mortgage with them was simple to begin with then became complicated. At first they were very responsive and helpful and while continuing with the process it became much less personal. Even when I no longer had a loan with them, I was constantly receiving ""personal"" emails that were clear they were sent to a large group and didn't help me at all. I felt like I was a number and not a person to them.",3
Haley,"New Ulm, MN","Reviewed April 13, 2017","I have been displeased from the very beginning with this company. The representative I had, first seemed great. Then not even a few days into processing for my loan, he asks me not once, not twice, but THREE times what my job history is in a span of a week. Every time I did that, I ended up having to redo things in the ""to do"" list simply because the guy never LISTENED. My next representative seemed pretty great. Whenever I got angry she always was calm and reassuring. However, every time she said that I no longer had anything to do, the very next day I had a new ""to do"" list item on the page. An item that was ALREADY done quite literally, 3 or 4 times. I don't know how many times I had to upload just my bank statements. Even though it was on my account, even though they received these, I still had to upload them. And each time, they found something new and odd about them. Apparently the first time looking through them wasn't enough.",1
Eric,"Los Gatos, CA","Reviewed April 13, 2017","My experience with Quicken Loans was very disappointing. I was switched between 5 different representatives with no warning. Constant requests for documents already provided by their automated website. Friendly, encouraging but ultimately dishonest representatives over weeks and weeks culminating in a rejection for incorrect data collected by Quicken. Don't trust anyone from this firm who will lie and lie and lie... their underwriting department is stupid and incompetent.",1
Whitney,"Franklin, IN","Reviewed April 13, 2017","It has been great with Quicken Loans. It was a streamline refinance, so there was not much paperwork. We did not even have to leave our home. They had people come to us for the title work. They made everything an easy and simple process. We only had to deal with the same few people, so there was no confusion. I like how personal they were with us. They made it so that there was not much for us to do. We did not have the best credit scores, and they still got us a decent rate. We even have a thousand dollars off of our next mortgage through them. They were amazing to work with.",5

I had made a phone call to make a appointment and then I went their and filled out paperwork and was told I qualified for the loan then it I was able to get the loan. I got everything I needed from the company and services and it helped me out a lot. I like the fact that they help you out with loans and mortgages and whatever help you need and great with the customer service needs. I'm glad this kind of service is available. Maybe the service could have been quicker with less wait and faster time with more representatives and faster wait time so the services go faster and they could help more clients.,4

I would recommend Quicken Loans to pretty much anybody, as my experience was second to none. Everyone was extremely invaluable to my personal process. I liked the customer service and support, as well as the representative who personally handled my case. It was extremely simple in every stage involved. In fact, most of the process was done over the Internet and the telephone. Everything was laid out for me and very easy to understand.",5
Danilo,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed April 13, 2017","My experience with Quicken Loans was the best possible because they have a line of credit and services open to all audiences, for each type of profile, that is, it is not restricted only to a certain richer class.

In addition to having lower rates, they have a system of loans without much burocracia and with enough agility. ",5

However, Quicken Loans had a long process to get the loan. The process was little tough and they wanted a lot of paperwork before the loan. I had to prove a lot to get my loan.

Jackie,"Fayetteville, AR","Reviewed April 12, 2017",I love Quicken Loans. It has been great. The process of our refinance was very easy. Everything you need to know is on login so it saves a ton of time trying to use an automated system just to talk to a person. Any questions you do have that's not on your login can be answered right away with their online chat. We were able to upload any docs they needed as well as e-sign all the pre-docs which is such an easy process. I like how fast and smooth the process was and everyone involved was very knowledgeable. They have the best process out of anyone we have ever used before local or otherwise. The only bad thing I would say is that at the beginning of our process I told them my parents were on the deed to our property and we wanted to get them off so they wouldn't have to sign the mortgage. Even though I told several people this throughout the process our when we go our documents and went to sign my parents were on the mortgage.,5

I found the service very good and efficient! The employees are very attentive and so captivate your customers. Also, I liked the facilities and multiple forms of payment offered by the company. This was definitive for me in choosing Quicken to make a loan of this type. And besides, they facilitate everything, it does not have as much democracy as the others of the market.

The rules were clear, simple, understandable, but... high interest rate so you need to quickly repay the loan. It was probably the price for the quick service. Generally I do not like to take loans. Sometimes there is no other choice. When taking a loan I always do not like the same things. I do not like that they are expensive, that you need to wait long, and that you have to pay more than you have received. I also do not like repayment schedules and that you cannot change it. But I must admit that everything went smoothly.The rules were respected and I liked that.",3

Although it does take time to apply for a mortgage it felt much easier doing it from home and you can have all pertinent materials right in front of you. They have checklists and materials to make it easy. They have a lot of information on the website to help you. If you are unable to complete in one sitting you can log back in to complete the application. My friend referred me to the site and it was an easy process overall. Hopefully they will have more opportunities for folk who may find it harder to qualify with the large Wall Street banks.,5

If we had a question, we could go read the frequently asked questions or call the number for customer service. At first the process was confusing as we weren't sure what we needed to do. If we didn't have the prompt and simple instructions, we would probably get lost in the process. We never had any trouble understanding our agreement. But the website was a little dry. I understand the process deals a lot with numbers but the website could be more user friendly. The younger generation is starting to look for gomes so appealing to them might be an option.",5

The process after that was super simple and easy. I was able to get my mortgage debt over in such a short period of time.

William,"Bradenton, FL","Reviewed April 8, 2017",My only deal with Quicken was fast and efficient. The process was smooth and simple with every little nuance being described in further detail. I can only say that they have absolutely turned this industry into one that is not scary nor intimidating. This made my wife comfortable as well. Their customer service was stellar and it made everything involved much easier and nicer. Quick turnaround of approval and this was in a very busy time of mortgages which tells me a lot about their processes and such. The pricing was incredible with all things considered as I have a sketchy credit history which they worked with me on extensively. The appraisal process was initiated right away and came off without any issue whatsoever. ,4
Jeremy,"Algonac, MI","Reviewed April 7, 2017",I used to recommend Quicken Loans any chance I had after working with them to purchase my 1st home using my VA. But about 2 months ago they purchased flood insurance to cover a shortage on my behalf that would have taken effect on March 1st. But I raised my already existing coverage to cover it since they wanted an extra $177 a month and to raise it only cost me $836. Since this fiasco they have been able to straighten out my mortgage payment and have even called to have me refi. They may want to fix their 1st mistake before they expect me to let them refinance through them. The refi comes back with me only saving $13 a month. No more recommendations will be coming from me that's for sure until they fix this mistake.,1
JoAnn,"Gloucester, MA","Reviewed April 7, 2017",I received my final documents to close and saw my closing costs increased by 3000 dollars - only when I questioned them was I informed my home with In-law apartment had been reclassified as 2 family and that impacted closing costs. In the course of my 30 years owning and 6 refinances this In-law apartment without desperate utilities has always been single family home. I feel misled and pure bait and switch.,1
Anita,"Ridgeville, SC","Reviewed April 7, 2017","We were very satisfied with our dealings with Quicken Loans in refinancing our home. Since we had already purchase home and had mortgages, when we decided to refinance we were fairly knowledgeable about what to expect. Quicken Loans had contacted us and were very assertive that they could help. They informed us of the options and how they could save us money. They explained about taking additional equity if we needed and prepared all of the documentation. They send documentation by Priority Mail and made it so much easier for us than having to sit in a bank or credit union for hours. They were professional, accurate, friendly, and fast. ",5
Richards,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed April 7, 2017","An agent visited my house to give me to understand what he really needs. They have been very good at what I need and at what they do. They are great in rendering service, and thoughtful knowing how to do things. The installations are very good, and almost perfect. That is something that helps a lot. Their preparations are very fast, and almost instantaneously. But sometimes it take a long time to order, so everything must flow in a more correct way because otherwise everything would be different. It is necessary to take into account that certain factors can be corrected to bring them to a better value but still it is influential in its majority.",4

Gina,"Lenox, MA","Reviewed April 7, 2017",Quicken Loans seemed easy and simple. It was quick and over the phone and online. They made it sound so great and low closing costs and apr. And the woman they sent to our house was very nice. But when it came time to sign the papers they sent a representative to our house and they had some wrong pages with another person's name on it. The closing costs were also over 1000 more than we were originally told. We had no choice but to go with the higher interest rate. We ended up paying much more than we expected and had to borrow money from a relative to close and this was very embarrassing to us. This was over 5 years ago. Never do it again with them. It was simple but in the end very disappointing.,1

It was the first time I had ever done something like that. Also it was super easy to use program. Didn't have to be a pro and beginning to end I would probably recommend it to someone else just starting out in the market because I knew nothing and I feel like afterwards I know a lot more.,3

I also understand that the percentage shown is not the one I'm most likely to get. However I wish they had a rate comparison to other major companies. I know it's easy once the credit score and income is calculated. But other than that it seemed to be one of the easier loans I applied for. In the future I do plan on using Quicken again, if I ever do decide to refinance my loan. I wish they had a free refinance for current customers, rates change daily and it's better that they get my business than going somewhere else.",5

Even after the process was complete, it was not unusual to get an email from one of my contacts, ""just checking up"" to be sure I was OK and not having any other issues or questions.

Some of the other companies that serviced my loan from time to time presented some difficulties, but when Quicken Loans took over I basically just received a letter from them saying that they held the note now.

Kay,"Southgate, MI","Reviewed March 24, 2017","We are selling a home in Michigan. Everything was going fine until Quicken Loans did the appraisal. They appraised it $15,000 less than what we are asking. Our asking price is less than comps in the area as we want a quick sale. QL gigged us for having a wall in the back yard that cuts off the view of a major street which I think is an asset. It would be no different than having a privacy fence. In the 3 weeks we had the house off of the market for these potential buyers, we lost numerous showings and other offers. The potential buyers lost money for the appraisal and the home inspection. If I have dual bids again and one has QL I don't care if it's $100,00 more. I will not accept it. Stay away from these people.",1

But anything with moving parts will fall apart and you're out the $400+ for their appraisal. The biggest issue that QL (and most internet lenders) pay their loan officers less. So you don't get a lot of experienced or good loan officers there. The ones that are very good usually leave to get better commissions.",4

When I accepted the offer with Quicken, I was required to put a deposit down in order to cover the upfront costs of the appraisal and processing. This amount would later be deducted from the closing costs and would essentially be reimbursed. After their initial appraiser couldn't make his appointment, they found someone else that could handle the appraisal. This was not the case, as they couldn't complete the appraisal before the rate lock was up. They said they would extend the rate lock for a marginal fee and we could move forward. ",1

In the end, they were able to fix the problems and we were able to continue with the process. It was definitely not a simple process.

The process of getting a loan is long and hard but the people we worked with were nice answered a lot of questions which makes the process a lot easier. That doesn't happen with most of these companies. In the long run it seemed to go pretty good even though a lot of information took some turns. But the things I didn't like was bargaining on the interest rate which was going a little high at the time but we seemed to work it out and the deal was going to be a good one.

I prefer to do things online so the online application, which is easy to fill out, is a good fit for people like me. The process was simple and straightforward and went smoothly for me. It’s much better than when I got a loan at a bank a few years ago and less stressful than with other places. I didn't feel pressured, lost or unsure during the process. It was easy to get the questions I have answered and the information I needed from their website. And for times when I needed more information, it was simple to get in contact with a real person to talk to.",5
Norma,"Terre Haute, IN","Reviewed March 18, 2017","I have had at least three mortgage companies, and Quicken Loans is by far the best. I actually first went online to go shopping for a new mortgage. I entered my contact information, and then left it at that. I did not really expect to get a loan anytime soon, for I felt that I needed to improve my financial situation. I just thought I would get information that would allow me to go into the situation more informed, in about another year. Well, Quicken, and maybe a couple loan companies, called me. All of the other companies, about a half a dozen, said they could not help me. Quicken, however, said they could. I was hesitant, but we got the process started. We basically got it done through email and an online account that I set up with them. I also faxed them a couple of times.",5
Katie,"Rancho Cordova, CA","Reviewed March 18, 2017","One of the things I very much liked about Quicken Loans was how quickly they got me a loan, almost like it's part of their company name. They certainly live up to their brand! Very professional about it, too. And the refinancing process for my loan was not very complicated. I basically followed the instructions on Google and the Quicken website and didn't have to talk to anyone, which was fantastic, as I hate talking to actual human beings. My experience with Quicken Loans has been an adventure. Overall quite pleasant with the occasional dash of crazy, but mostly good natured and manageable. But I quite disliked the name. While they lived up to it it sounds so nineties old school and somewhat unprofessional. A revamp might be nice, but would it then sell as well?",4
Leon,"Windham, CT","Reviewed March 18, 2017","I have found that Quicken is extremely proactive, easy to work with and very helpful in giving good advice about things such as rates and procedures.

Brian,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed March 17, 2017","Quicken was great to work with. The communication was wonderful and they made the process easy. I was continuously contacted to let me know the status of where my loan was in the process, the rates were competitive and the lowest of any of the loan providers that we looked into.

He was continuously communicating with me and explained any of the documentation that I was unfamiliar with and took the time to ensure that I did not have any questions throughout the process.",4
Vikki,"Sewickley, PA","Reviewed March 17, 2017","Quicken Loans is a great company to work with. They offer you professional service for the right price.

Excellent service.",5
Kim,"New York, NY","Reviewed March 17, 2017",The process was simple. Most issues were handled over the phone. We did receive many calls from the worker on our account. We felt at the time he did a good job. The nearest location to our home was close to an hour drive. He told us to come sign the paperwork and when we got there he still was not ready for us. He initiated the call for us to come in. He didn't indicate he was behind. We were there for a few hours. The worker was young. He probably has more experience by now and is more efficient. We have other ideas now that we would like to make happen if given the opportunity to do so. We would love to refinance our home to a lower rate. We try to stretch each dollar. We applied and refinanced about 10 years ago. Heard there are better rates now.,3
Arlisia,"Stockbridge, GA","Reviewed March 17, 2017","Quicken is better than any lender that we tried in the past, and I feel as if we built a personal relationship. I will use them in the future for sure. It's been great for the most part. I liked how personable they are, and that they take an interest in you and your concerns in the process rather than just the logistics. My questions were always answered to my liking. I appreciated the people that got to work with. Refinancing with Quicken was stressful. I had A LOT of questions but I felt as if they got us through it as painlessly as possible.",5
Ralph,"Alachua, FL","Reviewed March 17, 2017",I researched a few companies when I was first searching for a lender. Quicken seemed to be the best fit for my situation and also had pretty competitive rates and fees compared to the other companies. I used their mortgage service about eight years ago and received a mortgage to pay for the closing costs and fees associated with my home purchase. They have always maintained a very personal relationship with me. Their rates don't fluctuate much and if they do they are very upfront with why and when. I would definitely use them again in the future.,5
John,"Livermore, CA","Reviewed March 17, 2017","They have good customer service. They could solve my problem pretty quickly. Their interest rate is pretty good. To set up the account, it was quick. I could easily use their well-designed website. The process is very easy. I applied online and provided all the information. I got an answer pretty quickly. There was a customer service person help me each step of the way. The things I like most is they have 24 hours service. When I need help with my account, I could find out every problem quickly. I even could chat with them online. However, I could not find any local branches. I worry one day this company will not exist, and I have to find another mortgage bank. I also worry about this company getting too big, and interest rate will increase.",4
Brad,"Corbin, KY","Reviewed March 17, 2017","Quicken Loans always treated me like a valued friend when I dealt with them, and I appreciate that.

I would avoid them at all costs, if anyone is even thinking about using Quicken Loans -- don't bother. Incompetence every step of the way.",1

The process was very simple and I was contacted very quickly to get the process started. I like that the process was all online with the exception of the signing of the paperwork. The website was easy to navigate and create a profile for the purpose of getting a mortgages. It is intuitive and user-friendly.

Erica,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed March 16, 2017","It recently introduced an all-in-one all online service portal, which is great, because I hate talking to people (which you still can, if you want). The site has an easy to follow path and is catered for people like me. I loved it. It gave me the ability to price my loan, pick my rate, and explained the tradeoffs of going with higher or lower rates etc. I was able to lock in these interest rates worry-free. Some of the customer service agents were far from genuine. They felt as if they were reading a script of General Guidelines, rather than trying to solve my actual inquiries. They also kept pressing me for my SSN without satisfactorily explaining why. Quicken Loans has a weird name, but apparently it's the biggest online mortgage lender in the country, so obviously it has to be good, and it was. I have no complaints.",5
Chrystal,"Jermyn, PA","Reviewed March 16, 2017",I used Quicken Loans two years ago to obtain a mortgage that I still currently have. My husband and I were completely lost and had no idea where to start as far as obtaining a mortgage and Quicken Loans simplified terminology for us and thoroughly explained every step to us so we knew what to expect. They did everything they could to make the process smooth and completed in a timely manner. Their Customer Service department is wonderful! If I called and left a message the person in charge of my case would call me back within 24 hours. I was also able to communicate through their website which was very convenient at times. I am very please with their customer service and all the work they did and help they provided. Quicken Loans was successful in helping us acquire our first mortgage. We were extremely pleased that we chose to do business with them.,5

You upload your file onto their database, and they send it to the government, then you get your payback. The process didn't take any time and I still had some money left. I liked the fact that Quicken Loans helped me put a mortgage on my house and helped me save money. I think Quicken Loans was the best option for me and other people.",5
Susan,"Rochester, NY","Reviewed March 16, 2017",The salesperson was very nice and patient. The process was relatively quick but was still nerve-racking!

The whole process of getting a new mortgage is always stressful and a little confusing to me and I get anxious about it even if everything is going smoothly. It helps having a patient salesperson! It was great and I would use them again if I had to get a mortgage.,5

I went to the homepage found everything for sign up to be very easy and understandable. I would recommend it to a friend and I would love to show people. I also would renew my service and never stop using it. However, the prices were a bit high and the customer service was a bit slow, at times were unfriendly and mean to me. I would argue with them about the stupidest things.",4

Then, I called the customer service, and they took care of the rest. Incredibly simple process. The customer service was top notch, and I was able to secure a top mortgage. In addition, because of my excellent credit history, I was able to negotiate an excellent rate that allowed me to allocate other funds for other ventures. I also liked how responsive they were. When I initially called Quicken Loans, a customer service rep was on the phone in less than a minute, and she was ready to answer any and every question that I currently had for her. She was knowledgeable about the subject matter.",5

I just flushed $500 down the drain. I've dealt with so many different people, and answered so many emails and questions, and wasted so much time on the phone. It's ridiculous. Someone different calls you every day. Every few hours you get emails, telling you there are questions in your 'to do' list on your Quicken account. This is stuff you've already explained to one of the who knows how many people you've already talked to. It's like there's a contest in their office to see who can be the most incompetent jackass, and everyone is in first place. Do not waste your time with these people.",1

I had the house inspected that was $350. Then Quicken Loans states I'm not available for the FHA home loan as I'm very deep and excited to finally be done renting. At this time I've already told my family and everyone I know I'm buying a home and the offer was accepted. Now I'm very embarrassed as I've made promises to people I can keep now.

The communication was spot on and if I could not speak to someone right away they did get back to me within twenty-four hours. They also made the process easier than I thought it would be but it's neither simple nor confusing. It can be overwhelming with all of the information and documentation that needs to be received.

They were very beneficial in guiding us through the loan process and letting us know what to expect. However, I did dislike the fact that we had to completely start our loan over after our original underwriter was fired from Quicken Loans. This made our process end a month later than anticipated. We ended up switching loan companies after initiating work with Quicken Loans, due to finding a company to decrease our interest payment.",3

The listings were often confusing and even my family members and friends had a hard time understanding it as well. There were so many factors to learn, recognize, and memorize. They had great customer service. Most of them managed to help quickly and nicely with little to no assistance from others and helped me straight away. If it wasn't for the customer service, I probably would've been confused so much to the point I would've just given up on using it. If one thing could be improved, it would have to be the rates, as I feel some of them are a bit higher than it should be. Rocky, but overall good.",4

Always an excuse as to why they did not call back. I really felt like because we were not credit qualified from the start we were not as important to them. I tried going VA loan and they said after a couple of months they could not do that. So we started working on an FHA loan.

Shawn,"Wiggins, CO","Reviewed March 9, 2017","We already had refinanced with Quicken loans 1st time was a breeze. We wanted to change our loan from a FHA loan to conventional loan to save on MIP premiums. We started our loan process in November, it took 4 months to close our loan. They lost our paperwork numerous times, we also went through numerous agents to complete the process and 2 days before we were suppose to close we had to come up with $1600.00 in closing costs, we were told there would be no closing costs. We had to sign documentation several times to keep our rate in place because they took so long to process. If we had known we would have refinanced our conventional loan with someone else.

Their answer to this was ""After review we were not able to qualify you on the lower interest rate. I'm sorry we could not make things work out. I wish you the best and I will withdraw your loan application"". The original conventional loan had a 4.125 APR. The VA loan proposal started at 3.675 APR and finally ended at 4.124. Buyer Beware...

They need to be investigated and have to refund all the monies to their former clients. They ask you at closing, ""How were you treated."" I believe they do this in order to try and get good reviews. Again they are NOT A COMPANY you want to do business with, unless you want to be taken advantage of. They will tell you anything to get your business and then throw the SCREWS to you.

After 3 attempts and a HUGE amount of paperwork, letters, and pay stubs they always seem to find a way to tell me the loan was dropped. So after 2 appraisals the only thing Quicken Loans did for me was cost me $900 (first appraisal was $400, second was $500) and a lower credit score for inquiries (5). It's now December and yet again they find a way to drop the loan. Wish I had never contacted them in the first place! If you are considering them for a home loan... DON'T!",1

We constantly was asked to pay some debts off and we did it. We were jumping through hoops with the company. Now within 7 weeks and a lot of aggravation and stress, we decided not to go through with the refinance due to things keep changing and they keep coming up with different things they want us to. We have went through a loan process before with our local bank and it's never taken more than 4 weeks to get the loan processed. This is ridiculous.

Jeffrey,"N Chesterfield, VA","Reviewed Dec. 9, 2016","I have finally refinanced my home mortgage and escaped Quicken Loans. They are great at advertising their JD Power awards, however, in my opinion, that is all fluff. They will dig the applicant for atrocious costs, conveniently adding it to your loan so there is minimal out of pocket. Also, they are quick to offer FHA financing, but God forbid you have to have Mortgage protection insurance at the rate of nearly $200 per month. My refinancing required MPI and that was a whopping $28 per month. When I refinanced, Quicken Loans made sure to grab an extra month of MPI fee even though they rolled that fee into the loan payoff figures.",1
Refi,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Reviewed Dec. 8, 2016","I had been frustrated by being stuck in an FHA loan with PMI insurance so I thought I'd check around for a refi. Quicken beat the competitors rates and got me into a 15 yr conventional loan within 45 days. They made the process easy and didn't waste my time. I paid $500 in good faith. Of course, they have expenses up front including the credit check and appraiser so it is only fair. They refunded the $500 towards closing costs and I ended up getting $1200 cash back at closing and no mortgage payment for 2 months. So, in short they quickly and easily cut my rate in half and kept my mortgage payment the same. The only difference is now I will have my house paid off 12 years sooner so I'm a very happy customer. :-)",5

However it has now been 6 days and I have not received my funds. I am extremely disappointed in the process of getting my funds to me.

Keonna,"Bronx, NY","Reviewed Sept. 28, 2016",The people were friendly. I had no problem when going into the office or calling in. I would definitely recommend and have recommended them to family. It was very easy to read and understand. I had no problem filling out the application. They made the application process very short and simple. It was very easy to remain in time with my payments because they gave me the best financing plan. They helped match my payments with my pay day so that it was easy for me to remain on time. The value of the loan was very helpful. It helped get my kids' school clothes together and get other things they needed for school. I also had extra cash to get things that were needed around the house.,5
Meg,"Massapequa, NY","Reviewed Sept. 28, 2016",Great experience. Would definitely use again and recommend to anyone who's looking for a loan. Trustworthy and reliable and very helpful. It was a long process with a lot of requirements and qualifiers. Some language was confusing and it was extremely time consuming to figure out. Many different options for different individuals and incomes. I was very happy with the options that were made available to us and would recommend. Good value for what you safe applying for and looking to get.,5
Shymeka,"Philadelphia, PA","Reviewed Sept. 28, 2016","The customer service people were ever friendly. They answered all the questions that I asked them, and if they didn't know it, they found someone that did know. They also talked very clear so that I could understand what they were saying. All the questions that they asked were ever easy to understand. There were a few questions I didn't really understand but there was someone there to help me every step of the way. They gave me a few options to choose from that would be great for me. They didn't make me pick this one or that one where it wasn't a good fit for me and my income. Without this loan I would have never been able to pay for my dream home. I would still be working all kinds of hours to save up as much as I can just to get a house.",4
Mark,"Orlando, FL","Reviewed Sept. 28, 2016","They were very helpful in explaining the details the loan, so there was no question about terms and conditions of the agreement. Very friendly and able to work with me throughout the process. The application process was a breeze, especially since the representative was right there to review the forms and address any questions I had clearly and precisely. The financing options were more than agreeable for me. Lots of flexibility in choosing the mortgage package that worked best for my needs. I made a great decision to get a mortgage from them. It Alleviated a lot of stress for me. The entire process couldn't have been easier, and it gave me great peace of mind.",3
Nicole,"Baton Rouge, LA","Reviewed Sept. 28, 2016","The people were nice. It was a smooth and easy process. Thanks so much for making it easy on us to get approved and help us move into our new beautiful home where our kids will grow up and one day bring their kids to be with us. It was pretty long but that's okay. It was self explanatory to say the least, and my husband and I both felt pretty confident in filling it out. We were given a lot of choices and based on our credit we were able to go one of two ways and we were approved with the amount we had hoped for so all in all it went very well. We knew how much we needed and how much we wanted and we were approved for just 5k shy of that. So all in all we were able to pick a few different ones we had it narrowed down to.",3
Steve,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed Sept. 28, 2016",I am happy that it went as well as it did. The people were friendly and the process not that bad. After applying there were only a few more steps. Very Daunting and hard. I had never applied for a mortgage before. I didn't know all the paperwork that was required but they did a decent job of explaining it to me. To be honest there were not that many options for the process due to my distressed credit but I took the chance with them and it paid off for me. I get to live my dream come true of owning a home and having affordable payments and being able to take pride in my achievements. This is thanks to quicken.,3
Les,"Saint Paul, MN","Reviewed Sept. 27, 2016","I was very happy with the great customer service from quicken, as the agent was friendly, knowledgeable, courteous and took the time to answer all the questions I had. The application process didn't seem laboriously long, nor did it seem too quick to be inauthentic. It was efficient and informative. I was quite satisfied with the options quicken had for financing as they had a variety of options to assist in my individual situation. They made my options easy to understand, which I greatly appreciated. Quicken has brought a good value to my life as it was hard for me to get the financial mortgage terms I had wanted elsewhere. They made it relatively quick and easy to do!",4
Joann,"Pinellas Park, FL","Reviewed Sept. 27, 2016","Called to ask about lowering my interest rate. They were unable to do so but were very professional and friendly. They told me that in the future some new guidelines were being put into effect and they would contact me when the new guidelines were available to me. The application process was very easy to follow. I had a few questions that I wanted answered and they were very helpful in giving me the information I needed. I had the option to choose several different length of loan and the payment for each option. It was broken down by amount of loan, length of loan and interest rate for each. I had a good loan with payments I could afford which made for a better financial situations for me. Plus had an asset I did not have before.",3
Elizabeth,"Yucaipa, CA","Reviewed Sept. 27, 2016","They were very nice and very helpful. They made the process simple and easy to understand. They answered all of my questions without hesitation. It was very simple and easy. The application was upfront and impossible to misunderstand. It took the average amount of time to fill it out. Not very many options, but that was okay with me. There were just enough options to give me a well round choice. Very informative choices. It was of a good value. We got a decent rate considering our credit history and we have a good time frame for our mortgage loan. We are satisfied.",3
Allissa,"Decorah, IA","Reviewed Sept. 27, 2016",The customer service at Quicken Loans was very good. Everyone I interacted with was very friendly and helped me in any way I needed. They explained everything. The application process for a Quicken Loans loan was really nice and easy. I got approved and it was easy. The process was great. I thought it would be harder. There were many great financing options when it came to the loan that I applied for. I thought it would be more complicated but it really wasn't. The value of the Quicken Loans loan was so worth it. I thought it would be a trap and then I'd be stuck with a lot of debt. I was very skeptical but a friend assured me it wasn't a trap.,5
Miranda,"Knoxville, TN","Reviewed Sept. 27, 2016","They were more helpful than your average customer service, but nothing over the top. I would enjoy doing business with them again, and I had a pleasant experience. The application process was very over the top, lengthy and had unnecessary precautions. I guess they are being particular, which is understandable. Once you clear all of the red tape, they do provide a good amount of options of great financing for your home. I would do it again for this alone. The loan overall had some great parts and some average parts. Nothing so special above average, a few bad things, and a few good things to even out.",3
Sandi,"Queen Creek, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2016","We refinanced our home thru Quicken Loans just recently. Due to medical issues a few years back, we didn't have the greatest credit. I sent an email asking for someone to contact me. The next day, on a Saturday, Joseph ** called me and we went over all the options available to us. I told him upfront about our past credit and he said he was pretty sure we could work something out. He wasn't pushy and was very informative. 3 hours later I had set up my QL account and uploaded all the info he needed. He never made us feel like 2nd class citizens that he was doing a favor for. Everything went so fast. Over the next few days they requested a few more documents. It's so easy because you create an account that allows you to upload, download and view the progress of where the loan is at. ",5
Trevahn,"Sioux Falls, SD","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2016","The service was great... they really helped, and I would be stuck without it... overall it REALLY helped me a lot with my bills.

Jennifer,"Houston, TX","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2016","They really wanted to help me get the most affordable mortgage plan. They went over my credit, financial stability, factored in how many people who would have been living with me to make finding a plan easy. The application process was a little lengthy but authentic. I was asked to provide identification and show my credit to show that I was a financially stable person. The financial options were very diverse and ranged from very affordable to expensive. After deliberating for a few days I chose a plan that would benefit my family of three but is still adorable for our budget. I would definitely recommend people to this business. Their employees are kind and very helpful. They offer good plans and they are quite reliable, authentic and trustworthy. They don't lie about any hidden fees.",4
Rachel,"Shelbyville, KY","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2016","I have only needed to call customer service one time, but the person I spoke with was very helpful and courteous throughout our conversation. He knew exactly what to say to help me through the process of fixing my problem. I must say that I was none too impressed throughout the entire application process. I thought it was very lengthy, used much complex dialogue, and the instructions were a bit confusing. I thought that the financing options were reasonable. They were explained to me in relatively simple terms, and the options were designed to fit a wide variety of budgets. The value that the loan brought to my life has been immense. Thanks to it, I was finally able to afford my own place and I've been able to keep making my monthly payments.",5
Joel,"Florence, SC","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2016",They explained everything to me in terms that I understood. They took their time to make sure I understood. They took me through the process of the mortgage process step by step. The application process took about an hour and half. They explained my financial options and showed me the interest rate that would apply to me and showed me the saving I would save with their program. With their financing options I would be saving much more with them than who I was with now. They showed about the harp loan how much better it was and had less paper work. With the old loan I had the value compared to the harp loan I would be saving five hundred dollars per month compared to what I was paying month now.,5
William,"Bremerton, WA","Reviewed Sept. 25, 2016",They were a great bunch of people that I talked to. They listen and helped me a lot in the process and explained all the paperwork. Also they helped up with payment options and worked around my pay schedule so I could make my payments on time so didn't have late payment. The application process was very easy and straightforward. I did not feel that is was hard to complete and the fact that I had a answer within a couple of min of finishing the application process I knew how much I was going to get.,3

Tanisha,"Ocean Springs, MS","Reviewed Sept. 25, 2016","Very professional and trustworthy. The customer service rep was genuinely friendly and concerned about the issue I presented her with. She went over and beyond my expectations to resolve the problem I had. She even provided a callback a few days later to make sure the problem was handled. Most applications are very tedious and hard to fill out. This was not the case with the Quicken Loan application. I found it to be easy and doable. I was able to complete the entire application without seeking assistance, as I have had to do with previous loan applications. ",4

Very much a friendly, warm, helpful environment that is most essential in a complex high energy mortgage loan market that always entirely without reservations is there for the customers. The financing that was seemingly quickly unassumingly offered to me was an adjustable rate loan which is, dependent on the whims of the unpredictable aches and pains of the stock market. The particulars of the known values of this loan are the low interest rates that is paramount in my daily life for a person like me and my family with a moderate income.",4

I was nice to have a warm welcome to all my questions and not making me feel like I was annoying them. It was very quick and easy process. Always able to get answers to any questions I had as far as what paperwork I needed. I had a clear checklist of what papers I needed to provide them. They gave my husband and I a lot of clear options we could take and explained all of the options very well. Every time myself or my husband would call to ask questions about our options they were always very helpful. It was really a great process and value. My husband and I felt that they were there to help us making sure we could get our dream home and at a great rate.,4
David,"Anchorage, AK","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2016","I use their customer service on the phone and they are great customer service. I automatically transferred to a live person which helps me with my concern or inquiries about my loans. It was kinda long because my credit is poor and I have to make good credit first then they accept my application. It was a hassle applying for any loans so I understand why my application took so long. They have 30 year financing option that I don't think I like because it's somehow long, maybe I'm already dead by that time but it's worth a try for the next generation of my family. Value is worth it because I can transfer it to generations to generations of my family. It is expensive but somehow I can afford it to pay because of having a good paying job. If not then I'm in trouble.",4
Becky,"Myrtle Beach, SC","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2016","They were extremely helpful, they were able to answer any questions I had and they worked hard to find the best loan to suit our needs with payments we could afford. The application process was pretty straightforward and although it took some time of course with any loan it would take some time to complete. Once we got started they were there to help us should we need any help on the application. We had issues years ago with my husband being laid off so our credit wasn't perfect and that reflected on what options were available to us so I just wish that they could see we did the best we could and always paid on time so I feel we should be able to receive better options. We got this loan due to a couple surgeries that were needed and it helped tremendously because without it I would not have been able to have the surgeries that I needed at the time. I would have had to wait awhile longer.",4

Here we are, a month and a half later and no word on whether I am approved or not. Their website is a joke - they ask you to verify you paid off a $2 credit card balance (really, this is no lie) to buy more time. Twice I have been assigned to a mortgage representative who promptly went on vacation. The first time we went with Premier Mortgage and got a way better deal. The only reason I tried Quicken again was because they had all my information. ",1

The were plenty of financing option, we went with a 15 year fixed loan, but there many other ways we could have went. We also considered a 20 year loan as well.

Never will I trust them again. You first fill out a 1003 application. It's 4-6 pages. One of the two then you get all your I.D bank account info / employment. Give it to them you're in. They had a few financial options. They tried to push the non fix rate programs on me but I know those programs. The mortgage can go up 3-4 hundred dollars in 2 years.

Had no issues signing up and dealing with them. Application was pretty long but nothing I didn't expect while asking for that much money. They had about 3 offers in my rural neighborhood all of which were approximately the same but they explained the fine details out so it was easy to make the right choice. They offered me the best deals they had available at the time and guided me thru them all with very little issue and for a reasonable cost to me.,5

I thought that the rates they gave me were fair and I don't have any real complaints because it was the right amount for how much I asked for.

The financing options part is good because they have different options that you can pick and it shows different amounts you can get and how much it costs.

The application process took about 15 minutes and was completed easily with the help of the customer service rep. It was easy to understand with no hard to understand the terminology. Financing options were easily understood and I opted for the 30 year mortgage at a fixed rate which lowered my previous mortgage amount by over $100 a month.

We were happy with the financing we received and would have been happy Quicken Loans had they not sold the loan. We still have the loan with Wells Fargo.

Thia,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2016",I was approved but only for a very small loan amount and the payment was crazy high every month. The agents would not help me to get my payments lowered even after making all payments on time. The application was simple and quick. It was one of the easiest I've completed in the past couple years. I would recommend them for their application process but customer service is lacking. If your credit score isn't pretty much perfect your monthly payments are going to be huge. At that time my credit score was decent but they wouldn't work with me to lower payments or raise my credit score. In the end they are not worth it. I would reconsider if they ever changed their requirements and cost of monthly payments. But until then I can't recommend them. They seem like they aren't business to help people but to make more money for themselves.,2

I went in to apply and it was fast and easy just as expected. I had no issues and was very happy. It also was free to sign up, some places charge you more! They had a wide variety of financing options, some I never even thought of. I was very happy with the overall selection and things I could choose between. The value is great. The price was really cheap compared to the competitors and honestly it worked better than I expected it too. The value was my main reason for purchasing.",5
Christine,"Aurora, CO","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2016","Any issue that I had was dealt with quickly and thoroughly. When I called to have things dealt with I was able to speak with the same person can have my problem fixed immediately. I never had to call twice. The application was the easiest one I've ever done. It had simple step by step instructions that were very easy to read and comprehend. Quicken Loans had the most financing options of any lender I have ever put in an application to. If something didn't seem to be quite right for me, I had someone call me to suggest something that would work better for me. Because of Quicken Loans, I now have my very own beautiful home and I never expected to be able to buy my own home. I am no longer renting and live in a gorgeous neighborhood that is safe for my children.",5

I was very impressed with a myriad of aspects. It is very rewarding to refinance and become closer to actually owning our home. The application process was very easy to complete. Our application went very smoothly. We have excellent credit, so there was no problem with approval. The financing options proved to be sufficient for our needs. We wanted a short term option and we're really provided the perfect parameters. I am so happy to have extra money and a low interest rate. The first house I ever bought had double digits interest back in 1988.",3
Izzy,"San Francisco, CA","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2016","It is a very reliable way to be able to contact customer service! It provides reliable, quick and just very helpful feedback on our own help! It is very helpful with full on problems that occur! It takes a little too long in my opinion! It should be way shorter as it can help get through the process a ton faster than it usually is! It has a great transaction, involving the prices and it is overall just amazing! It makes just amazing decisions for us and the customers overall! It is just the best but not in the world overall! It helps me out a lot! I think that all of the manufacturers, consumers and the customers will and overall love it! It is just the best thing in the company itself besides for the customer service itself!",5
Benjamin,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2016","The employees were friendly and polite. They were also respectful, and very discreet. They knew how to do their jobs, and the process from start to finish was painless. It was tedious and grueling, and terribly repetitive. I had to wait for some time for all my information to be processed. Filling out so many form, my hand became cramped and sore, all the while not being certain I would be able to receive a loan. There should be a far faster way to approve somebody before they fill out all that repetitive questioning, and waste all that time. ",3

Thomas,"Bakersfield, CA","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016","It was not the best but they did do their job effectively. The employees were short tempered and did not seem to care about my needs. Even though I chose them above the many other places out there, they should have at least showed some concern. It was long and really complicated. It seemed like there was the same question worded differently several times. They used complicated words that an average person would not understand very easily. They had 4 different plans to choose from, but they were not really anywhere near what I needed. I ended up having to compromise for a lesser deal, but the positive side is it is cheaper to pay back. It was not really a value. The interest is ridiculous and the deadline is rather short. Although the it was fairly fast. The place was pretty close.",3
Jacob,"Birmingham, AL","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016","Everyone I encountered was very friendly and made the process much less stressful that it usually is. I hear horror stories of loans but I know I got a great deal here. Application was very simple and easy to navigate. Any questions I had were quickly answered by the friendly staff. Had it all done it 10 minutes. Great financing options for students without a lot of credit. I felt lucky I came here first and had so many great options to choose from. My perceived value was that it's definitely a fair price, especially after comparing quotes to other loan agencies. Definitely will be using this business again.",4

Quicken Loans helped make a usually stressful experience not so stressful. Quicken Loans works to give you the most money for the best financing. Several options were offered and available.

Glad that Quicken Loans was available.,4
Shawna,"Jackson, TN","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016",Customer service was very helpful in answering any and all questions I had. They made themselves available and listened to what I had to say and my concerned. The application process was very very simple. They made it to where I had options of how to apply but I applied over the internet and then called them to finish the process. The financing options available are outstandingly good. You have many different options and they will work with you to come up with what is best for you. Definitely a good value but only if you need the loan. I wouldn't suggest just going out and getting the loan based on the value. There are other factors.,5
Eric,"Greenville, PA","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016","I applied for the loan and within 30 minutes I was approved and I was treated to snacks as I waited and they were very polite and courteous.

Lesley,"Lafayette, IN","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016","Everyone was very helpful. They were very informative so I understood everything and they were explaining to me. From the moment they answer the phone they pointed me in the right direction with patience. Although I didn't appreciate the interest, they gave me solutions on paying my loan back without incurring a lot of interest. During the application process, they asked a series of questions. I was able to email my information versus faxing which was very convenient. They asked me for my banking information etc. They explain all of my financial options. I wasn't sure which one to choose, but they were very informative and explained each option and made it an easier decision than if I would've done and on my own. They live up to their reputation. All loan companies charge interest however with this loan company you don't feel as if it's unfair, plus they give you options.",3
Andrew,"Fresno, CA","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016",The customer service was really easy and straightforward. You are not on hold for very long and the customer service representative is an English speaking person so there is no worries of outsourcing to another country and talking to someone in India.

Interest rates were bearable and was able to make complete payment when I had sufficient funds to do so. Value was priceless.

Maxi,"Falls Church, VA","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016","Very difficult to get a hold of anyone to speak to in the first place, had to wait on hold for long periods of time, and was seemingly constantly redirected or referred back and forth. Although long and arduous, it was fairly comprehensible and user friendly, so I felt competent enough to complete it without having a lawyer present. Most of the information required is fairly standard and to be expected. There were actually a number of options available that I was unaware of previously, making the process seem more hopeful. However, those options were not ideal and many came with a potentially damaging catch. This seemed ultimately like a reputable service that did indeed ease financial burden and provide helpful services that allowed for tangible and observable improvements. I perceive the value as high.",3
Stacy,"Gilbertsville, PA","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2016","The customer service is pretty good. I've never had a bad experience or long wait times. I'd highly recommend this loan company to anyone looking for a first loan company to start with. The interest rates aren't too high. It wasn't too long of an application but it wasn't short either. If you have a location near you, you can go in and they will help you fill out the paperwork. It was good. Very reasonable and not a high interest rate as long as you make your payment on time. Very great company with great ethics. This loan really helped me out in my time of need. I had some unexpected expenses come up and didn't know where to turn to. Thank goodness I did my research because I found the best company.",5
Nicholas,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2016","I worked very hard to save and get my credit over 800. I took time off from my job to drive around WA and MT looking at homes.

After they looked over my information and with no credit card debt, my x5 bmw was paid off, and I was putting 80k down, they told me I would get 3.36 APR. I should have got that in writing, so I made it clear that if they couldn't give me the very best I would go with GR or Lending tree, they assured me my excellent credit got me their best, so just before closing at 30 days they sent me an APR lock, at 4.25.

Jose,"Temecula, CA","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2016",They were able to quickly help me get the money I needed and all I had to do was show basic information. The payment terms were reasonable and I was to pay it back ahead of schedule. The application was painless and quick. And I was approved quickly for a loan. I thought the process was effortless and the terms of the loan were clearly made known to me. I thought the financing options will work if you're responsible to understand it's in your best interest to pay off the loan as quickly as possible and to make all payments on schedule. Quicken Loans provides an invaluable service when you're in a financial pinch but it requires discipline to understand that this loan needs to be repaid.,4
Catherine,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2016",Some of the people have a terrible attitude. But they do get the job done. The interest rates are what make it annoying. Buy I am willing to use them again. The application process took about two weeks. Two business weeks though. The weekends did not count. But I did get approved. And I'm lucky I did. The finances were the only annoying part. I technically pay more for a loan. Which is the part I didn't like whatsoever! But I needed it honestly. The value was decent. Especially if you are able to pay the interest finances after the loan is approved to you. So make sure to have extra money not just the amount you are guessing.,3
James,"Johnson City, TN","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2016",Customer service was as good as it could be. They were prompt and courteous. I would recommend them to everybody I know. They are surely a leader in their field. The application process was smooth and fast yet through with great support. I would recommend them with high regards. In the mortgage world they are the best of the best. The financing options are what you would expect and more. They go way beyond any ordinary company and make you feel like you are number one. The perceived value of the company is excellent and you could not ask for any better value than what they give you. You are considered a valuable client from beginning to end of the process.,5

Financing options vary greatly and everyone can find a financing plan that works for them and their lifestyle. Quicken offers a variety of financing options. Quicken offers a lot for what you pay.

Randi,"Buffalo, NY","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2016",Customer service was ok. No complaints about them. Interest rate are a little high. Could do better with that. Would use them again in the future. Application process was a little too long for me though. It takes too long to fill it out and needs way too much information to complete the process. The financing options are a little unrealistic. They are way too high. Some you end up paying more than you borrow. Which is ridiculous. The value is way too much. Interest rates are way too high. There is some companies that charge a lot less rates. So shop around before applying with them.,3

They have many options for financing to offer and guidance. They help choose the right option for me and explaining the refinance process for later in life.

For any type of loan process of anything involving money I could see what it would be important for there to be a in depth application process. The financing options were exactly what I needed. When acquiring a loan it can be hard to qualify for the amount you need and set up a payment plan that fits the need of a person at that time in their life.

There were many possibilities of different loans and interest rates to chose from so it made it very easy to fit me and my wife with the loan that fit our budget.

They had several different financing options, from 30 year to 15 year also 10 year mortgages. Also had couple of different options that I had never heard of.

Kandee,"Champaign, IL","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016","The customer service when I was confused and need help. They were very helpful to my needs and assisted me very quickly. They helped me understand my issue and how to resolve it. The application process went very smoothly. A lot easier than when I went through a bank. When I had questions, there was someone there to assist me with them. Quicken Loans helped me get a loan that was affordable and in my budget in order to get the house I wanted. They were great to work with. The value of the loan was great. I was able to get a low interest rate. A better one than if I were to go through a bank. Very easy paperwork.",5
Ron,"Knoxville, TN","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016",Great service. From the loan person who handled my application process from beginning to end. Was a quick response to my request. The loan application was not a long process as I imagined and the loan rep was very helpful and answered all of my questions in explaining the application process. There were many financing options as explained by the representative in applying for the loan and was explained by the rep in detail to make the loan process better to understand. The loan helped me get on with my life by eliminating my money problems and made it less stressful with my financial situation in order to live in and keep my home.,5
Ryan,"Worcester, MA","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016",This wasn't as bad as many other mortgages. It didn't seem as arduous as with a traditional bank. The customer service itself was helpful and didn't seem forced. The application process didn't have any horrible speed bumps. The financing options seemed to be extensive. This loan allowed me to convert my original home into a rental property and purchase a new home which checked off many more wish list items than my first. Great experience overall.,4
Leon,"Dickson, TN","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016",They helped us with the paperwork. Answered any questions we had. Quick to call us back. Just very helpful. Helped us get our credit report. Make sure all the information on the report was correct. We would highly recommend them to others. The application process was clear and easy for us to understand but if we had questions or needed help they were available to help us in any way they possibility could. The options we had for financing was wonderful. Different amounts so gave us options that would fit into our budget. Made it very easy to pick what was best for our family. You could not find this kind of help for that price anywhere else. Help with financing and advice. So many options for our family. To us it's priceless.,4
Sarah,"Allentown, PA","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016",Friendly staff. Not a terribly long time on hold. Quick to help and serve. Willing to talk and not rush. Care about each client. Not a number. Once again quick and rather easy to follow. Any questions were answered appropriately and promptly. No hassle or struggles. Seems about average to other financing opportunities available. They were well laid out and offered. Simple to learn more about. Overall value is good. They definitely stand by their values and are able to put the customer first in what they do. Good with problem-solving.,4
Pat,"Fontana, CA","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016",I really thought it was one of the best that I have ever had. Plus they were really nice. I liked it. Additionally I think that the people had polite attitude and answered all my questions thou rapidly. The application process was fairly easy compared to certain other banks which would request way more information than was actually needed. I always liked Quicken and their efficiency. I guess that's why they are still in business. The financing options I have to admit were very good. They knew exactly what I needed when I needed and I think that's what makes them awesome and great. The value has brought so much of my life. I can do a lot of things without constantly having to worry about where and when to pay my loan. I don't have to count pennies which is a great thing.,4

I had many questions which were answered in a timely manner. I liked going to my ""personal"" site and viewing my documents at any time day or night. I would use them again. We especially love Sean **, who went way above and beyond, even when we experienced a personal tragedy, called to check on us. Process was very quick and orderly. Once you commit to applying it goes straight to providing the background financial documents, and with the helpful assistance of a 'coach' to negotiate the needed files, it was easy. All of the QL people that I dealt with were very knowledgeable and courteous. Communication with QL staff was excellent at every step.",3
Shadia,"Villa Park, IL","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016","The customer service was great and simple. I had all my questions met. There was no technical issues and it was fast service. I had no problem getting transferred either. Very easy to apply. I had to put my information and contact details address. Also they run my credit but had no issues. You mail the form in and get an answer within 0 days. I didn't have to do much. All I had to do was finance monthly, pay a small amount each month. I was satisfied and have no issues nor complaints and I'm very happy with this company. Everything is easy and straight to the point. I would recommend to everyone I know.",4
Lisa,"Great Falls, MT","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2016","Very helpful customer service. Very knowledgeable and friendly. They answered every question I had, and helped me with some things I was confused about. Long, but easy application process. Very easy to read and understand. Also spelled out clearly what the terms and agreements were, so it was not misleading. Had a few financing options, but I would have liked to have seen more. The options were clear to understand, though, and explained the terms and agreement of all options shown. I used it to buy a house, and after 15 years fell onto hard times. They wouldn't work with me, and kept calling even after I spoke with them to set up a payment date. I felt harassed.",2

They put in writing they would not modify mortgage due to the credit rating they helped lower by falsely reporting more than 30 days late and used my 17-year-old son's child support and the SSDI income that will stop soon... For a 30 year mortgage. Now are telling me they want to refinance again after seeing that I had been looking for a different mortgage company to take over home loan... how do they know what I'm doing?

He said he would talk to his boss and came back and said his boss matched the rate is, went over the numbers, and her stated the other company didn't take out enough impound so I was still apprehensive, but I said I would go with him and he wanted my credit card number to charge five hundred to order the appraisal. I said ""hold on. There is another person on the loan that had a bankruptcy 9 years ago and the house was in the bankruptcy and Chase didn't take the house back for 3 years and was not recorded.""",1
Kyle,"South Bend, IN","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016",The customer service was perfect and they helped me get the right loan I was looking for.

Robin,"Jackson, MS","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","Courteous, helpful, easy to talk to, understanding, user-friendly, quick service (no, that is not meant to be a pun), they make getting a plan easy & even enjoyable. Not frustrating at all. Very nice representatives. Completely professional. Not hard to understand. Simple process. Efficient and precise. Better now that they have their own lending service, don't have to wind up with your mortgage going to an unknown entity when all is said and done. Wish it had been that way when I first used them. Quicken was very easy to work with and made the entire process simple. I did not have to go to a broker's offices or bank or attorney. They sent their representative out to meet me at a mutually agreeable, public location.",5
Heather,"Aberdeen, NC","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016",Representatives were not helpful with my situation and seemed unknowledgeable about the terms of my loan. Long wait times on the call wait for a seemingly simple issue. The application process was easy. Easy to follow directions for the application on the website. Slow loading pages but may have been connection issues on my end. There were several financing options to suit my personal needs. They were able to tailor my finance loan to my needs and budget. Very satisfied with the loan options. The availability of my loan has made it possible to give my family the home we have dreamed of and we are very happy with our mortgage rate and options.,3
Michael,"Fort Wayne, IN","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","They were very easy to work with. I would work with them every time I needed a loan. I have used the phone, internet, and their app, and they have all worked the same. I have used all three and they all work great. I have used them three times and I wouldn't use anybody else. They will work with you in many different ways and what they say is what you get. Their rates are always the best. I wouldn't go any place else. I have tried many different banks credit unions and by far they are the easiest to work with and their rates are always the best. If you go anyplace else you are throwing your money away.",5
Sidney,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","The overall experience was quick but whenever it came to having questions on technical things they were always looking for the person who might have the answer. What I liked about this party was that it was quick and pain free - it wasn't long before they told me I was approved and once that happened everything was fairly smooth. The financing options was one of my most liked things about quicken loans, because a lot of them were very good deals for the everyday consumer. A lot of loan companies do not have good deals and that was why I shopped around.",3
James,"Dearborn, MI","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","Based on the location you visit customer service should vary but the one in my area has very respectful individuals working for them that actually know what they're doing and are very helpful. If you have decent credit you shouldn't have any issues with the application process. Once approved they strive to keep your business so they'll literally do anything to keep you as a customer. All their financing options vary based on your needs. They offer mortgage assistance, credit card loans, and car loans. Whatever you need they have!!! The value of the customer is based off of the value of the customers. Your business is very valuable to them hence the reason why they're a multi-million dollar company.",4
Robin,"Philadelphia, PA","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","They were very polite and discrete... Quick to answer my questions and very knowledgeable staff... Returned messages and calls within a reasonable time. Quick response team. Very quick discreet application process... They took the time to speak with me and answer my questions. I had many doubts in my mind and quicken loans was able to put my fears to rest. I would have liked to have a few more options available, but I was very pleased. Low mortgage rate and actually affordable payment. I'd suggest them to anyone. It is hard to put into words how much value this has placed in my life.

They got me the best rate available and was very happy with how easy it was to provide all the needed documents. Definitely recommend.",4
Cindy,"Muncie, IN","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","They are really helpful. They take time to answer all of your questions. They are easy to work with. They feel like you really know them and are friends by the time everything is done. The application process is the worst part of the whole process, but they are there every step of the way helping you through everything. It is easy to upload the documents right to their site. It is just a lot of documents and it is time-consuming scanning them all into the computer. We did a VA loan so there weren't really options for us. I would definitely recommend using them for VA loan. The thing that I value with the company is there are not any hidden fees. They make you feel like family and are very helpful. More companies should be like them.",4
Robert,"North Bend, OR","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","Answered quickly, usually solved problem then and not have to call back. Short wait time, they are respectful to you and you can tell they want to help. Some of the sections you need help with because of the language used. It can be done on the computer so the application will save trees. The company will give you many different choices in how to pay. This makes it more accessible to a wider range of people. You can pay one time a year, which is nice because then you do not have to worry about it for a year. You do get a great value for your money. They value your time as well. 30 years of experience makes them a stable and reliable company.",4
Jenna,"Wilson, NC","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","I highly recommend them for their outstanding customer service because they are well informed, respectful, cheerful and patient when they are discussing the various options available to their potential clients. The application process is a bit too time consuming. It is probably one of the only drawbacks that I can truly describe about the Quicken Loans process. The financing process with Quicken Loans is one that I find easy, affordable, competitive and understandable. It is self explanatory. The ability to choose from various options makes it easier to pick what works for them as an individual. The value of the service offered by Quicken Loans is one that I find appropriate and affordable. There is an easy way to compare and an efficient way to see if what is being offered to you as a client is more or less valuable than what the other competitors are offering.",4

Always nerve-racking applying for a home loan, but they made it easy. Very glad I went through this application process and thankful I was approved. There was many different financing options available to me that varied in interest rate and length of the loan term. They were very helpful in breaking down the different terms. You cannot put a real value on being able to buy a home for the first time. Quicken Loans made it happen and now my family and I have our own place.",4
Talyor,"Madison, WI","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2016","They were not clear about terms and conditions when I asked. Also, I needed to stay more than 10 minutes to reach customer service. It took multiple steps until I can get the answer, which was not clear enough. As they advertised, the application process itself was very quick and simple. You do not need to prepare many complex documents to apply loans. It was quick and simple. The best thing about this service is that they provide various financial options. You may find the best and the most comfortable option easily. I had very urgent need for cash. They provided simple and quick service, which allows me to handle the emergency easily. It was very helpful if you are in emergency and are able to pay back in a short period.",2

They help you when you need help with whatever it may be. I would recommend it to anyone. The application process is easy and at a decent process to do. The application process is not hard at all. It asks little to not hard questions about yourself and the plans. I think the financing options are easy and affordable for anyone who need their financing options. Their prices and rates are not really bad either. They are affordable to get. Even if you have good or bad credit you can get financed. The value of it is good the way it is and is very affordable with their pricing and plans. Everyone likes their value of the item as to others. I think the value of it is good the way it is.

My credit score of 710 and 155 thousand a year income trying to use my V A loan was not enough. The loan officer never called us with anything and when I called her she would responded with ""I let you know in 1 to 2 business days."" I would call her back 7 days later because I haven't heard anything from them. They worked on this loan for almost 3 weeks until it was 2 weeks before our closing date.

However, they are very well trained in providing the information to me with the credit report. The loan officer did the right thing letting me know where I stood.

They provided me with services which allowed me to pay a lower down payment and reduce my interest rate with no other bank was able to offer or beat.

They let you decide what to put up for collateral. They will look at your income to see how much you can afford to pay back. The interest is a little high in my opinion. I have never been late on a loan. They let you double up on payments to get the interest down. They help you indeed. The value is good.,4

They offer a wide variety of financing options to choose from and make things clear trying to explain which one would fit better for your needs.

You get a fast precise response and don't have to sit around and wait for a reply in the mail like you do with other places. They offer several finance options and although I don't like the interest rate, it is comparable to most other companies that also offer loans.

Dana,"Waterville, ME","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2016","It seemed alright, they were very polite and friendly and seemed like they really knew what they were talking about. The process was quicker than I expected, it didn't get delayed or held up like I have previously experience. Quicken Loans definitely lives up to the quick part in their name. They had about the same options as other lending companies do. Seemed a bit pricey but I needed the money so I'd be glad to pay the extra amount later so I can avoid all the hassles from not taking out a loan.",4
Kam,"Pearland, TX","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2016","They were very pleasant and had a relatable attitude. I was not nervous when talking to a representative. I was also glad that I chose your company over others because of the service. The application process was very easy and did not take a long time to complete. I felt like I knew and understood the responsibility I was about to take on. There were several ways to get financing through your company however the process was pretty easy for me. There were no holdups. Of course as the consumer I would want a better deal. Yes, yours is not bad at all which was why I ended up choosing your company over others. However, I would like the deal to be a little better, but what do you expect?",5
Kit,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2016","Was very fast when I had a question, so I got a direct response from them. Was friendly and nice to me. Every question were answered. This was a bit difficult because all the information they wanna know was so extreme in details. I guess they just wanted to make sure I can apply for a mortgage. But in the end it works out good for me. There were many options I could choose. I had to speak with somebody to find out what fits the best to me. I got good help on the phone. Quicken Loans has a very good value. In my opinion is it one of the best choices you can make. Easy to use and very appealing for me!",4

However, I am not too far from the required credit rating to be able to refinance, so I wanted to get some information for the future.",1
Tokkara,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2016",My call was sent to someone in India I could barely hear and he was very rude. He kept me on hold for 45 minutes twice. He kept misspelling my name even though he repeated it back twice. I have never in my life had to fill out a application this long and on top of that I had to fill it out 3 times cause my information kept disappearing. On my last try the site completely froze and I had to come back later to fill out the application yet again. They did have a lot of way to either repay what you borrow. I chose to quickly pay back my amount before the designated return date which seemed to make them happy. The value was what I expected it to be. Nothing more nothing less. I knew actually what to expect and when and there wasn't any secret or hidden surprises. I was happy cause a lot of places have hidden agendas but not this company.,1

Harold,"Port St Lucie, FL","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2016","I recently applied for a refinance loan. There was prior questions on an outstanding lien. I explained that it had been lifted and wasn't sure of the status. An apparent subsequent credit report to the Quicken Loans Co. caused a rejection of loan application and lost of my $400.00 (appraisal fee) deposit. I complained and (through their channels and supposed in-house investigation) the denial of the deposit refund was upheld. It seems clear that the motive to secure the application fee was deliberate deceit. My credit worthiness must have been on top of the list of things to consider before exhausting (supposedly) my funds. I feel ripped off and expressed it to a number of persons responsible for ""looking into it"". There should be protection for applicants seeking help rather than adding to their burden.

Candace,"Philadelphia, PA","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2016",My mortgage nightmare started with Quicken Loans in May 2013 when my mortgage was sold to Quicken Loans. I called to make my first mortgage payment and was told my loan had been paid off and my account was closed. Shortly thereafter I received a mortgage satisfaction document in the mail and same document was sent to the county tax office where my home is located.

They were also very patient with me and helped me understand the application. The financing options were okay. I was able to get the loan I had wanted/had needed. The financing was a perfect pick got me and what I could handle. I am very happy with the value of my loan. I was able to borrow the amount I needed without having to feel like I had to pay way too much than what I thought was worth it.,4
Samantha,"Fort Wayne, IN","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2016","Very good about explaining the process and answered my questions thoroughly. Always contacted me in a timely manner and assisted me in the first time loan experience. The process was very fast and easy. It didn't take long to see all the great opportunities out there and to find the right fit for my family. Due to my average credit score, I was pleased with the results. They matched me with a wonderful lender. The interest rate we got was more than reasonable. I was very happy with the value the loan has brought to my life. I am able to be a first time home owner. It's so wonderful to have enough space and a home to call my own.",4
Troy,"Marinette, WI","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2016",Constant contact was made with me during every important part of the process. From start to finish they contacted me quickly and provided the most efficient and quick method for me to provide what was required to close the loan. The third mortgage I have worked through and by far the best support provided. Super easy using their RocketMortgage online tool. They were able to acquire the majority of the information required to determine loan approval just with the information I provided on the form. The other two mortgages I have worked through with different lenders required me to mail or fax information to them that Quicken Loans was able to obtain themselves.,5
Jack,"Houston, TX","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2016","The customer service from what I have heard because I have never contacted them is very good and I can say that they are very good. The application process is a little lengthy - a boring in my opinion but it is very explanatory and easy to do. There are plenty options and most of them are great. I definitely happy with it, the value what you're getting is great. It has not brought a whole lot to my life but it has made a lot of things easier for me and my life so I definitely recommend these loans to anyone - easy to do and pay off.",4
Christa,"Pasadena, CA","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2016","The customer service reps I worked with were pleasant and easy to understand. The process overall was smooth and I would work with them again. I didn't have any issues with this process, they have a streamlined system that made it simple. I would recommend this service to friends or family interested in a mortgage. They gave me several options (I chose a 15 year fixed rate) to choose from, suitable for any preference. There were plenty to choose from, so I was satisfied I made the right choice for my financial situation overall. The loan I was provided allowed me to fulfill a longtime goal of home ownership, so it has added greatly to my life overall. I'm happy with the value that this loan has given me.",4
Brinna,"Castle Rock, CO","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2016",The people I talked to during the process were all very helpful and polite. They helped with what I needed and answered any and all questions I had. They made the process easy and simple. I did not find the application process any different than others I have looked into. It is not any more complicated than others and asks the same questions. I had no issue with the application. The financing options were diverse and I believe accommodated for most needs. The financing options I chose fit my needs. The diversity made the stress of a loan less than usual. The loan enabled me to accomplish a dream I had. The achievement of the dream makes me incredibly happy. I would not have been able to achieve this without a loan and I am happy I had with the experience I had.,3
Vickie,"Knoxville, TN","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2016","No issues with their customer service one way or the other. They were appropriate and professional every time I dealt with them regarding my loan. Application process was very lengthy at the time I was searching for a loan. I felt like it took too much time. That was several years ago though. I received almost a dozen financing options which was absolutely incredible. This was a tremendous asset received by using their services. Very pleased. I was extremely satisfied with the multiple options and the value brought with each. If I ever need a loan again, I would definitely consider going through their website.",4
Kellan,"Astoria, NY","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2016","People who work there were very polite and knowledgeable so I must admit that their customer service is on a high level which is undoubtedly significant and important for successful company. I can only praise their customer service. It was not hard at all, it was very simple and understandable. I got adequate explanations and advice so application went great with a help of great and knowledgeable employees who know their job. Considering my financial situation and my past experiences with finances I got a lot of option to consider and finances were completely appropriate and options I had to consider were great. I choose the most suitable options again with appropriate help and guidance. Great value, somehow a little bit expensive but still for that products I got value is correct and fine so I don't have any complaints. Because of that I think that value is really good and people can cope with it.",3
Elizabeth,"Cedar Hill, TX","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016","The people were friendly and knowledgeable, albeit a little pushy to get the loan through. I think it shouldn't have been rushed. I think the facility could have been a little cleaner too and in a better location. The application was easy to follow and self-explanatory. The reps were available to answer questions that I had. It wasn't as long as I thought it would be. They had a variety of financing options available to any type of family and income needs. They were willing to work with you if needed. I think it would have been good if there was a 0% option. It has helped me obtain my home which is very important for my family. I feel secure and proud to be in my own home. It's a lifelong dream.",3
Jen,"Breinigsville, PA","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016",They were very helpful when I called them. The customer service was nice and pleasant to speak with and answered all of my questions. I would use them again. It was long and painful of a process. However in the end it worked out well. It took awhile to get all of the paperwork completed on their end which was a little frustrating but someone was always available to talk. They had many financing options and I was very satisfied with the options that were presented to me and my family. I would recommend them for financing options. The loan has been very helpful and helped us get the home we wanted. By using this we were able to not only buy a home but build it to the custom designs we wanted.,3
Earl,"Danielson, CT","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016",Service was excellent. People were easy to work with and very easy to talk to when I had a question. All were well informed and courteous. I was given very clear instruction on what was needed and what I had to do. Quick and easy instructions to follow to get the application started. Was informed of what was being done and where the process was in relation to being completed. The options were explained in easy to understand language. My best option was a VA loan. It was explained how it worked and why it was my best option.,4
Lisa,"Boston, MA","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016","I didn't get a lot of great information from customer service. I wasn't confident that they actually knew what they were talking about. It felt almost scripted. Quick and easy. I almost felt like it was too easy. It should take more effort to get a respectable loan. I'm not sure I'd use them again in the future. Plenty of options for returning the money over varied amounts of time, which helps me lower the amount of interest I'd pay back. That part of the process was very appealing to me. Interest never seems valuable to me. While a loan is a necessary evil, the rates weren't as low as they could have been for someone with great credit and a perfect return history. They could have done a little better.",3
Jerome,"San Francisco, CA","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016",Customer service was great. They helped me get my loan quick fast and easy. I spent no more than 20 minutes inside on a busy day. The ladies were great help really knew how to get the job done. The application process was a little long. A lot of extra signatures for no reason could have left this out. But the lady inside helped me throughout the entire process which made it fast. The options were all there offered a bunch of ways to pay back the loan. I chose to pay back the following month. They were really understanding about money income days. The value of Quicken Loans are very good. I was able to get a large loan and pay back a small interest rate back. This place really works with you and what you have.,4
Jessica,"Lawrence, MA","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016","The customer service was one of the best parts of this company. The agents were extremely friendly and kind. So helpful and knowledgeable of the product offered. They explained everything thoroughly and was very polite. The application process was fairly simple in terms of mortgage loans. There were a few things I needed help with but the agents were great and made sure I understood everything. It was average length and it didn't take too long to complete the process. I was happy with the financing options that were available. I know now that there are other companies that offer better service at better rates, but I was not upset with this one. I didn't feel overcharged or like the option I needed wasn't available. I am very happy with the value I received. Everything that was necessary was covered and at very fair rates. I don't feel like I didn't get enough for my money. Customer service alone was worth the rate as they were amazing.",4
Jamie,"Hollywood, FL","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016","They were fast, friendly, good people. They're based out of Detroit but I got a loan in Florida. They have a 1-800 call number. I dealt with them on several occasions. They took all my information and as quick as that I had a loan from a very trusting company and I recommend them to anyone or for future mortgages on my part. I applied online and received a phone call within hours actually. It was pretty fast and quick and painless. They did a credit check, check my financial records as quick as that. Me and my husband we're looking forward to our new home without you kids. ",5
Tiffany,"Sumter, SC","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016",They're available to answer any questions. They will always make sure your needs are met. Quick and courteous service. They make it super easy to qualify. The application process was quick and easy. They let us know upfront exactly what documentation we needed & when. Didn't take long for a decision.

Jessica,"Middlesboro, KY","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016","The customer service is absolutely outstanding. They go above and beyond to help, fix issues, and make sure you're happy with them and their business from the beginning to the end. The application process is easy enough. As anywhere, it takes a little time to fill everything out, but not so long that you feel as though you're answering the same questions over and over. The application is simple, easy, and basic. They have a ton of different financing options, and payment plans for those as well. Don't get overwhelmed by the many available options, they are there to help and will do just that. The value of the loan was exactly what we needed. It was a nice enough amount to get us caught up, and ahead with money to spare. The payment plan was awesome as well, easier than I could have imagined.",5
Jess,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2016",They were friendly dependable and smart. They helped me out when I needed it most. Walked me through the process and always kind when I had questions. I was surprised by how nice they were. I thought the application would be long and tedious but they actually helped me with the process and most of the applications was pretty standard and not too difficult as one may imagine. The financing options are smart. You pick the best for your situation and you don't spend too much time figuring out the math yourself. It's straightforward. And you have a clear understanding. Worth your time if you need a loan. Quicken can be the best solution when you need it most. I needed the loan and because of their great service I'm back in business and enjoying life.,4

They strive to make sure that you have a great experience and less stress than other places. They actually care about their customers. The application process was a long one, just like any mortgage company but they made sure to take the time to explain everything to you through every step of the process. They have really great financing option there. So then you don't have to feel like you're stuck with just one option. You have the freedom to choose however you like. I was happy with the value. We got a great deal with low interest. Who could really ask for more? They just have great rates and options period.",4

Gayle Anne,"Cabot, AR","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2016",They make the process very relaxed and they explain all things so well and they are so very patient and take as much time as a customer needs and the value is great. From the time you arrive and begin the application process is very relaxing and there is no pressure and they explain everything in such great and easy to understand detail. There are numerous financing options that will suit anyone who choose to go with Quicken Loans and the rates are very competitive and most are better than any other lender. The value is indescribable actually. They will make sure you get exactly what is best for the customer and they never pressure you to pay for more than you can actually afford and will be able to pay for.,5
Brandon,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2016","Customer service from Quicken Loans is on par with the quality and service you would receive from similar businesses. Not necessarily lacking, but nothing impressive or outside the ordinary experience you'd expect. Quick and to the point. The application process is straightforward and fairly simple. All that is required is the standard information that you'd expect to provide on a mortgage application. The financing options available to choose from are satisfactory. I would have liked to have more options available to choose from, but this was not a big deal by any means. The value of the mortgage offered by Quicken Loans is what you would expect. Roughly the same value you would receive from its competitors. Not bad. Not great.",3
Cee,"Charlotte, NC","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2016","They waited patiently as I asked them how to do everything I needed help with. Answering each question in a very clear voice. Taking me step by step through the process. I think the application process asked a bit too much information but everything else was pretty much easy to fill out. It took maybe about 10-15 minutes to fill it all out. The financing options was very clear but it might have been too many option which make it hard to choose which one you would choose. Some of the questions sounded very repetitive too. The perceived value was wonderful. It had some very affordable prices that are for all different categories rather you have low, meduim, or high income.",4
Jeff,"Washington, DC","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2016","Not entirely truthful about everything they promise. I was told it was the cheapest way to go and that turned out to be very untrue, costing significantly more in the long run. It was simple to apply. The problem came with the company making good on the things they promise. Make certain you read the fine print or you may regret it. Quicken offered a variety of different options but were a tad deceitful when explaining them. I am no expert on such matters and trusted them far more than I should have regard in which to choose. Other options that they offered would have been preferable to the I ultimately chose. I believe they are capable of being a great option but you have to know what you are doing.",3
Ernest,"New York, NY","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2016","They had a really great customer service. They had an awesome staff that is always happy to help you with any questions about everything related to any step of the process. The whole application process was really really easy to do, even more than with similar companies. The best is that you can always ask for help to any employee. They had many different financing options to choose - if you are sure about what you want everything would be easy, if you don't, could be easy too because they would help you to choose the best option for you. In that moment, I really need that loan and I trust in this company and they trust in me. That is the best value that I can ask as a client.",5
Frances,"Snellville, GA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2016","I was very pleased with their service. They treated me with respect and I felt like a VIP customer. They answered all my concerns. The application process was good, easy to understand, not too much to read or sign. Agent sat down and explained everything to me and answered all of my questions. They had great rates and different options to choose from. All the other places I went to did not have the great option they had. I would recommend it to all of my friends and family members. The value I would say is one of the very best out there compare to their competition they have. I think very highly of their value and think what am paying for is worth every penny.",4

I was happy that they offer financing options that would be affordable in my price range. I really like the way they offer their financing options. It is a lot of easier to understand. I am more likely to accept their financing options at this company than at others. The value of this loan is a lot better than the one on the market. I really like this loan a lot better than the ones I have previewed before I made my decision. The ones I looked at before we're too expensive or I did not like the deal.,4

We used the mortgage service and we also refinanced our loan. Both processes were extremely easy. They also did a great job getting us a great rate and were understanding when we refinanced.

You waited till forty-eight hours before closing to tell us that the loan would not be moving forward. This was not due to a credit issue or an income issue, it was strictly based off of the fact that you felt that my current landlord did not write the rental verification form, which is COMPLETELY absurd!!! We have done nothing but jump through ridiculous hoops over the last six weeks to try and get all these unnecessary documents for you people. FHA rules only require twelve months of rental verification, which we provided, you guys were asking for twenty-four. Of which we provided twenty-two.

Mike,"Spring, TX","Reviewed June 14, 2016",Decided to refinance my house because my wife and I decided we wanted to have kids. Refinancing would save on our monthly house payment to be able to support our family's needs. After 1 year we received a letter from the mud district saying our taxes were delinquent. I sent the information to Quicken Loans because this was included in our monthly payment. After their investigation I received an email from Quicken Loans telling me unfortunately the title company they use (TITLE SOURCE) forgot to include the mud tax in my loan. I explained to them the reason for my refinance was to save money. I am now paying $100.00 plus per month. Had I known I was going to pay more per month I would have never refinanced my house with Quicken Loans. Who refinances their house to pay more money? I am now struggling to meet my family's needs due to this. I would never recommend this company to anyone.,1

I am a Gen-Y/Millennial and appreciated the MyQL portal and willingness of my agent to work around my traditional business hours for phone inquiries.

We closed on the home well within 60 days of my initial inquiry (again, I was impressed). HOWEVER, I'll echo the other comments here regarding Quicken's shoddy documentation.",1

First, I was told out of pocket fees would be $3,300.00, which is acceptable. The terms of the loan were quite attractive as well. My wife and I both have credit scores in the high 700's. I asked the lady if the out of pocket fees were solid and we would not be surprised with higher fees later. She assured us that that fee was it. She then asked if she could begin the credit application and get the $500.00 deposit. I told her ""No, call back later."" I met up with my wife and ran an amortization chart to see our real savings, and it looked like we would save around $50,000.00 through the life of the loan. ",1

J,"Manchester, CT","Reviewed Jan. 24, 2016","My experience with Quicken Loans is by far the worst mortgage experience I have ever had. In the beginning they can't do enough for you and tell you how easy this is going to be and how much experience all the people you'll be working with have. Once you agree to move forward, that's when the nightmare begins. The mortgage rate all of a sudden goes up a point or two, when you complain, they change it back. Then the closing costs are higher than what you were told, again, you have to complain for the costs to become lower (really what you agreed to). They badger you with more paperwork than any other mortgage company, and when you fax it they claim they never received it. When you tell them you're not sending it again, they miraculously find the paperwork.",1
James,"Cayce, SC","Reviewed Jan. 20, 2016","I have never felt so lied to, cheated, and mistreated in my entire life. These people do not care about you in any way. They are more than happy to harass you constantly about documents but don't dare ask them for anything. In total, I submitted 96 different documents. Every day they wanted more and more. I was quoted numerous totals and here I am, 5 days prior to closing and the final closing disclosure is more than it ever was. My interest rate is higher, my monthly payments are higher, and the entire thing is wrong. I have never been so upset. This entire 3 month process has come down to the end and I am thousands into this with NOTHING to show. And now, I'm not even getting the house. These people steal from you. BEWARE.",1
Lee,"Grand Prairie, TX","Reviewed Jan. 14, 2016",I do not understand or completely believe the reasons why my monthly mortgage payment keeps going up over 50 dollars a year. In fact I am almost back to the original payment I had prior to the Refi. I don't understand how I could have an escrow shortage every year even after I made larger payments than required. I feel like I'm being scammed somehow and do not know how to figure out how this can be. I've had several homes and this is the first time my payments went up constantly with a fixed rate mortgage.,3

Garry,"Lincoln, NE","Reviewed Jan. 12, 2016","I was looking to compare rates on an investment (2nd) home with a conventional 15 and 30 year term. I saw the commercial on TV and thought, what the heck, I'll try it. I started the process online. Ended up digitally chatting with an agent, as I couldn't finish the process on a second home quote, via the standard web interface. I felt a bit uncomfortable sharing personal information without knowing during the digital chat, if I was talking to an outsourced agent in India, etc. I was assured that the agent I was talking to, was in the US and a licensed loan agent. We finished the information, some 30 minutes later, and was to be contacted the next day to discuss the options after the research, credit check, etc. Within hours, I was emailed a letter of approval for the amount needed.

Sharon,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed Jan. 11, 2016","Applying for the mortgage was fairly smooth. I was assigned to a facilitator who moved things along. The problem was the appraiser they used. This guy was newly licensed (I checked his credentials with the state) and knew nothing about housing prices in my Seattle neighborhood and used comps from inferior neighborhoods. He appraised the home for several hundred thousand dollars below market value. As a result, even though the LTV ratio was 50% when I applied, the appraisal pushed it to about 60%, and that resulted in an increase in my loan rate. This was for a 5-year jumbo ARM.",2

I had to call and get the payoff (which took me a whole 5 mins but they could not get it done in 2 months). My husband works out of the State and is only home every 6 weeks, so they were told we would need POA so I could sign... Which added time to the closing. They said they weren't told. Requested to use closing company that I had use when I had originally purchased the home.

FG,"Carson City, NV","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2015","High-pressure sales tactics with products that do not meet customer demand, i.e., high cost, rigid loans. There is no provision for living trusts without forcing the customer to place the property back in the trust on his/her own after Quicken has taken it out because of a backward view of legalities. They offer no no-points, no cost loan products. They require impounds for property taxes and insurance.",2

I submitted tons of documentation overtime for 3 months and every time I leave a message on their MYQL and asked for a loan update. It seems like they can't give me definite answer why the process is taking so very long.

I saw the charge post to my checking account that same day and got right on the phone to alert them to the ""mistake"". I've since spoken with eight different Quicken ""customer service"" representatives. All have agreed that this was Quicken's error. All have promised it would be refunded promptly. It is now December 1st. No refund. Several ""updates"" by customer service people ""frustrated"" that this is still ongoing. Hmmm, imagine my frustration. Buyer beware. They're quick to take your money, more than they said they would, but they are unwilling to give it back when they've made an error. So, what should I conclude - liars or thieves?",1

Luisa,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Reviewed Nov. 24, 2015","I tried to refinance my home. The process was very difficult, since Quicken Loans requires all documents to be sent electronically. It is difficult to find the time to go make electronic copies to send and if your internet connection is not good difficult to email or upload the documents. The Quicken Loan representative we got was pushy and rude and didn't seem interested in helping us get the best loan but just on making a sale. We asked to be switched to another person but were told we couldn't as he was our rep. Overall we ended up going with another company.",1
Martin,"Sun Prairie, WI","Reviewed Nov. 24, 2015",Quicken for loans allows me to live my life more and not spend so much time on the computer paying and researching bills. It makes calculating things easy and a thing of the past. I really would use it and am happy my bank supports it.,4
John,"Macomb, IL","Reviewed Nov. 24, 2015",Couldn't be happier with Quicken. They have truly been the best. Customer service is top notch. Many different types of loans to suit your needs.

Smita,"Woodbridge, NJ","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2015","Called to refinance my home. Very high sales pitch! Will want you to fill in a loan with all the personal details and even after running a credit check (which I was reluctant) as I just wanted to compare rates. The operatives are rude, speaking over you, singularly on their own agenda! Decided to go with another bank, but the two operators Alan and Mary left a bad taste in the mouth. Same experience with them when I was trying to buy the house in 2008 and I went with Huntington bank. Don't know why I called this company at all?",1
Fluer,"Covina, CA","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2015","Sorry, the entire process was just a huge headache and hassle.

Wish I could take the entire experience back.",2

Jennifer,"Rochester, MN","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2015",These loans are ok if you can pay them off within a few days. After that the interest rates are astronomical and it becomes very difficult to get out from under them. The harassing phone calls for 3 to 4 days before your payments are due are also irritating. Even if you are on time every due date and ask them to take you off the call list. They say they are not able to.,2
Alan,"Rincon, GA","Reviewed Nov. 23, 2015",I went on the site when I was looking for a home loan. It was easy to use and was not complicated. Even though I did not use the site for my loan it helped me understand some of the process of applying and obtaining a home loan.,3

I told them ALL 3 of these things in the very first conversation we had. I did NOT hide anything. I was very open and honest and the whole way through they said ""yep we can help no problem."" Might just take a little longer.",2

Celia,"Highland Park, MI","Reviewed Nov. 22, 2015","The initial process was long. However, they were very thorough.

Mark,"El Paso, TX","Reviewed Nov. 22, 2015",I found it to be a smooth process and they helped me out when I needed it the most.

Don,"Mount Pleasant, SC","Reviewed Nov. 21, 2015",I used them when I bought my home. It helped me get the best mortgage rate I could get. I got a great interest rate of 3.9 percent on a 30 year loan.

David,"Waitsburg, WA","Reviewed Nov. 21, 2015",Very easy process of getting a loan to buy my house! I would recommend them above all others.

Nessa,"Pearl River, NY","Reviewed Nov. 21, 2015",Well I was really depressed as I had just lost my job and my mortgage was overdue.

I was threatened by the bank that they were going to take my home and I made up my mind I would not give up so easily. I searched online for various options and I finally came across Quicken Loans.

Christine,"Waco, TX","Reviewed Nov. 20, 2015","It was handy to have but, I do hope I won't have to use another one anytime soon.

I had several follow up questions and each and every time was answered without problems. The process from start to finish was assisted completely. I really didn't know what I was doing and they were more than happy to help with all the steps and any confusions that I had. Most people do not realize that you have to do all the steps. They are there to help with all of those. The greatest part is that everything is done either online or on the phone.,5
Geoff,"Scottsdale, AZ","Reviewed Nov. 20, 2015","Quicken Loans is a good bank, but there isn't anything, I would say, is unique about the experience. It feels like any other bank.

They said that they could lower my interest rate on my primary, and include my second - which would have saved me almost $300 per month. The mortgage banker who called me said that it was a ""no brainer"". As I was soon to find out, about the only ""no brainer"" was me, for buying off on this mess.",1

Jennnifer,"Joplin, MO","Reviewed Nov. 18, 2015",The associate that helped me was not accurate on rates or interest that should be added.

After I decided to withdraw, the representative keep begging me to continue with the process and told me that that was it after I restarted the process. Two weeks after, he came back with more stuff needed, making this a process of more than 3 months. I have a household income of 140 thousand dollars and own two properties valued $500,000 out.

Brian,"Bayside, NY","Reviewed Nov. 18, 2015","They try to make it as simple for you as possible but just like any other loan service, it's lengthy. I tried it once for the ease of doing it online but in the future I might just sit down with a bank and do it with a person so if I have any questions they can answer it for me right there. If I have time to spare, I would use the bank. If I was short on time, Quicken Loan makes it a little easier on the sacrifice that you may or may not understand everything.",3

I also found that if I wanted to upgrade to the 2015 from the 2014 I would have to pay for the upgrade (it was more than the savings).

Heather,"Shepherdsville, KY","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2015","Initially, Quicken Loans offered a refi rate that couldn't be beat. I did a little research and chose to proceed with an application with them. They were pushy, needed a fee immediately to get started and lock in the rate. Against my better judgement, I did so. The process took months to finalize. My appraisal came in way low, making me unable to roll my HELOC into the loan (though I had been told originally this would be no problem). My rate was subsequently raised to a point that it was no longer the best offer I could receive - though at this point I was too far in to back out. (They said they was because I was out of the rate lock period... Thanks to them taking so long to close it.) ",2

If Quicken Loans took knew their products they would know to look at a conventional Freddie loan and not try to shoehorn us into a FHA loan. I get it, most of the people in the call center are fairly junior but in order to make money you gotta know the market. And they don't.",1

I got a check for $750 instead a week after closing instead. All in all a very positive experience. They did everything they said they would in a timely fashion.

Lisa,"Webster, NY","Reviewed Nov. 2, 2015","I believe that for most part, it is there when you need it. They provide loans of all types and it is a quick, fast service but a bit too expensive for my taste. The mortgage rates that I've seen are always a percent above the average.

The next morning, we're told there's an issue because we live with family and don't pay rent! We needed a co-signor. We provided a co-signer and again told that was exactly what we needed.

Warren,"Mesa, AZ","Reviewed Oct. 28, 2015","My wife and I contacted Quicken Loans for a home mortgage, mostly because of the positive advertising seen on television. The interest rate we were quoted was very nice. All our documents were submitted and things appeared to be moving along smoothly. Our individual credit scores were near perfect (mid-800s) and with two businesses we had plenty of income and basically no debt. However, towards the end of our document review with everything submitted, we were unexpectedly given a higher interest rate than originally quoted.",2
d,"Austin, TX","Reviewed Oct. 28, 2015","Our loan was smooth until the appraisal came in low. The builder somehow managed to get a revised appraisal to magically match the sales price, based on adjusting 1 subjective line ""View"" and basing it on other properties that weren't included in the comparable property analysis and wasn't even in the neighborhood which included other lots with the same ""view"". Quicken did not take any actions to address the apparent shortcomings and seemingly was willing to accept the flawed report. Since the builder was threatening $150/day late fees, we could not get Quicken to order a new appraisal and meet the close date. We ended walking away and losing our $7,000 in deposits. I would not recommend them as when you need a partner for any issues, they were no help.",1
Nikki,"Bronx, NY","Reviewed Oct. 28, 2015","From start to finish, the entire experience was extremely positive. Very attentive customer service who kept us informed every step along the way. Very easy communication through email and myql.com. Easy to submit documents through that portal too.

I got a check for $750 instead a week after closing instead. All in all a very positive experience. They did everything they said they would in a timely fashion.

The questions were appropriate and not extreme in terms of asking questions that made me feel like they were not being invasive although of course by nature personal and financial information needs to be obtained by the lender.

Quicken Loans made it possible for me to pay my bills and really helped me dig myself out of a real tight jam. I couldn't have done it without them. Thank you so much.,3
Laura,"Mckinney, TX","Reviewed Oct. 25, 2015","Received a preapproval from them. When I called to follow-up it was very loud. I was transferred multiple times. They took a ton of information and then told me because of the kind of loan I had, I was not approved for refinancing.",2

Cynthia,"Warren, MI","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2015","Quicken Loans makes the process of getting a home loan easier -- its process is streamlined and convenient and the loan officers and staff are very professional and helpful. Although most of our documentation was submitted online, reducing the amount of paper shuffling, our loan officer was easily accessible at our convenience and even gave us his personal cell phone number in case we needed to contact him with any concerns or questions. I definitely recommend this company and will happily do business with them in the future.",5

Alex,"Buchanan, NY","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2015",I reached out to Quicken Loans to try and receive a mortgage for a Co-Op in New York in early July. They had provided me with a pre-approval for a loan and that allowed me to go forward and make an offer on an apartment. Ever since that point their gross incompetency has actually kept me from acquiring a loan and I lost the apartment. As of this Friday (10/23) when my closing was scheduled for Tuesday (10/27) they called me and changed the conditions of the loan. They are unaccommodating and I would recommend anybody looking for a loan to look elsewhere.,1
Rolando,"Miami, FL","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2015","My main problem with Quicken Loans is that they promised they would be able to do my re-finance to only lead me on for almost a month to find they could not. My mortgage was originally with Bank of America and I was trying to get a HARP loan. When I tried they said they would not be able to because it had lender based PMI, and Quicken Loans was unable to process this type of loan which caused me to have to waste a considerable amount of time and effort for what ended up being a dead end.",1

Rachel,"Kendallville, IN","Reviewed Oct. 23, 2015","Quicken Loans does not tell you all of your options for refinancing your mortgage. Most middle-class people qualify for the HARP loan. I caught them in several lies and then did all the homework. My appraisal came in half of what my home was worth. They said it was because only one duplex in the last five years had sold in the area. I called a realtor and found out different. 6 had sold in the past five years in my town. Now that I found out about HARP, no one will answer my calls.",1

Howard,"Flushing, MI","Reviewed Oct. 19, 2015",I did not shop around enough for a home equity loan. Quicken Loans was easy to apply to and fit into my busy schedule. I applied online and was approved for a loan almost instantly. The interest rate offered was 1 1/2% higher than a local bank. My wife took the time to apply at a local bank and got a much better rate. I did not use Quicken loans for this transaction. I can say that I had no complaints about the company.,3

Carol,"Shreveport, LA","Reviewed Oct. 19, 2015",I recently tried to refinance through Quicken Loans. The rep first seems very nice and told me I was locked in at 4.875 which was better than all my other quotes. It turns out I was locked at 5.125 with 2 points added to my loan at time of closing. Nobody notified me the changes and I walked out of the closing without signing the documents. I will never do business with them ever! ,2

He was nice about it and willing to help us know what to do to correct the problem. All in all I was happy with the service.",3

Yarina,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Reviewed Oct. 18, 2015","Depending on a paycheck, they give loans. There are some jobs that are solely based on tips and isn't shown or a way to prove so I got less of a loan because my check didn't say what I actually made including tips I make. So when I make almost 1,000 a WEEK because my paycheck only had 80$ because we only get paid 3$ an hour, our money is in tips, I was only able to get a loan for 100$ when I needed more and I obviously am able to pay it off. What job would pay 3$ an hour? Of course I make tips, that's where my money comes from. It's common sense but the employees at Quicken Loans were so rude and acted completely dumb. It was super unpleasant. Only reason I am giving it an okay is because one person tried because I originally was only going to be allowed like 60$, they let me go to 100$ and of course I paid it back on time. Probably the last time I go there unless I'm helped by that specific person.",3

Jasmine,"Honolulu, HI","Reviewed Oct. 17, 2015","We applied for a VA refinance with Quicken Loans and was told upfront which documents I would need to provide to begin the loan process.

And sent the required $400.00 security deposit for the appraisal. My online account was available and the documents sections showed complete. I was able to see the loan amount and interest rate (locked in). I was contacted by the person who would be handling the loan from this point on.

Carol,"Minneapolis, MN","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2015","We did everything we were supposed to. And then the inspector showed up. QL never told us that the VA typically undervalued homes between $15k & $20k below market. But, our home, in the current market has a sale value of $220k. So, all we needed was a value of $165k to cover the refinance. The inspector however, valued the home at $155k. Not only NOT in market value for the neighborhood, but under the loan amount. He used 3 homes NOT in our neighborhood - and in fact, from a high-crime, high rent area. Our area has many long-time homeowners and the home values range from $190k to $290k easy. QL said they'd work with us. They wanted to know the amount of our 401k to leverage - uh, read the paperwork, if we had a 401k we probably wouldn't need to refinance. ",1

Derek,"Fayetteville, AR","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2015","My multi-month experience with Quicken really opened my eyes. Initially, everything went well. They will hound you for documentation, even if you have already uploaded it. When we went to underwriting, it all went south. The underwriter had incorrect information regarding our income, our student loans, and was unapologetic about it when confronted. He was also totally incorrect about federal guidelines regarding student loans, which I was able to verify. In the end, we were denied and nearly lost our new home purchase. I went with a backup lender whom gave us a better rate and went from application to closing in 22 days. Patient sellers also helped a great deal. Quicken is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. They will make you jump through hoops, then drop you without so much as a care.

Elizabeth,"Chickasha, OK","Reviewed Oct. 6, 2015","I have been dealing with Quicken Loans for three months now. The big slap in the face came when I was scheduled to close on my home on Friday, October 2, 2015. Quicken failed to notify me, or my agent, or anyone else for that matter that we would not be closing on that day! They needed YET more documents, but they HAD NOT notified me. It was the most disappointing and incompetent work I have yet to encounter. I have faxed them 86 documents, and, at times, I have faxed the SAME document five and six times. They always claim that they did not get it... despite the fact that I receive confirmation via a REAL person that they received my document. It's been nothing but a nightmare! Please, if you have another choice, please do not use Quicken Loans. I have no idea how they receive ANY accolades for being a ""great company."" God be with you if you decide to go with them as your lender.",1

Aanand never made contact with me after that to explain what was going on. He shut us out completely! That is unacceptable! I sent buyer to a local lender and was told he didn't understand how Quicken Loans can send a pre approval since his ratios were not there. I will never recommend or accept a pre approval from Quicken Loans. My buyer's EMD was almost compromised due to the carelessness of Aanand. My buyer lost his appraisal and inspection money.

They asked for documents and letters from people that, at the least, were ridiculous and impossible. We complied with their every whim. We became suspicious whenever we checked the details of our loan and discovered that the payoff amount of our current mortgage actually GREW in size, rather than decreased over this 2 month period. I called them and asked them to explain this phenomenon, as we had made regular, on-time payments to our current mortgage company during this long, drawn-out process. They had NO explanation as to why a payoff would actually go up, rather than down, as any reasonable person would deduct. I must add that I checked the current payoff of our mortgage and the numbers did not jive with theirs. ",1

He took it to his manager (so he said) and came back with the same rate but lower closing costs by 1K. I said ""OK,"" and then he asked me for $400.

LilBrat,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed Sept. 29, 2015","Quicken loans will give you basically a fake pre-approval promising to loan more than your current approval. Even if you send them pay stubs, taxes and bank statements they will refuse to take you through underwriting because they know they cannot beat the competitors loan and want to stall you. After you've already made offer using their fake POS pre-approval letter, they will tell you underwriting found an issue or they made a mistake calculating your loan. Don't be surprised, this is their scam. They know at this point they got you where they want because by this time you've already signed a contract, put down a deposit, probably paid for inspections, appraisal and wasted a lot of time your time. Not to mention if you ask any questions they don't like, good luck hearing back from them. What a shame.

Matthew,"Spring Hill, TN","Reviewed Sept. 4, 2015","Quicken Loans is the worst company I have ever dealt with, from their poor customer service to their unfulfilled promises. They bait you in with low closing costs on refinance. They take way longer than the 30 days or less they say in closing a loan. They bounce you around to 4 different people handling your loan process. Their appraisal did not even count all the square feet of our house and they would not listen to reason or actual documentation I had to prove the correct size of my house. Their customer service people are unprofessional and only read a script continuously repeating themselves until you want to go insane. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a company. Buyer beware. Go with another company if you value your time, energy, sanity and money.",1

The disclosure figures were all messed up and didn't match. They make it very difficult for anybody to get a loan. My credit score was 802. And my wife's was 756.

Thomas,"Daytona Beach, FL","Reviewed Sept. 3, 2015",We closed on a purchase with Quicken Loans in January. We closed a couple of weeks early before our deadline. I found out FHA dropped the mortgage insurance by at least 40% within a week of our closing. With 2 months Quicken is calling me to refinance with them so I can save $60 a month. They knew the MIP was changing when they closed my loan but chose not to tell me. So I am stuck with this extra $60.00 until I pay for a new refinance. I had many other problems with them which I chose to overlook. I would not recommend Quicken Loans unless you want to tear your hair out.,1

Well that never happened, then we got a call that we would be closing on July 31st. No one showed. We stayed home all day expecting to hear from someone at any moment (it was a Saturday). On Monday they called and said ""the loan is still in review and you should be closing soon."" Well it is now September (5 months so far) and we still have not closed.

I own a $925,000 dollar home outright and I was trying to get $400,000 out of it to use. Quicken Loans keep leading us on with more and more demands for documents and excuses. I could have gone to a local bank and been done by now. My credit score is 736 – 748 depending on which bureau and have w2 income of over $250,000. I own several companies--all profitable--and have owned and operated them since 2009. I feel like they lied to me several times just to keep me on their string when I could have just gone someplace else. The $500 up from they take should be illegal. This experience I had with Quicken Loans is one of the worst I have had in 10 years. It was terrible! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! For your sake listen to me.",1
Lori,"New Rochelle, NY","Reviewed July 28, 2015","I am a real estate agent and Quicken was horrible to my buyer. I'll start by saying that her credit score was near 800 and she had almost zero debt, less than $5000 owed on a car. She has a great job with 1/3 of her income coming from a state pension. Quicken used an appraiser who made a ridiculous requirement- that the city combine two tax lots. The contract and deed covered both tax lots. Why would an appraiser get involved in legal affairs which is outside his license? I do not know! Then once that condition was cleared instead of allowing us to close, Quicken added new conditions to the commitment. Each one had been cleared 2-4 weeks prior. The process was ridiculously stressful. Timing is always important and my buyer could have lost a $70,000 down payment if we didn't close by a certain date. Quicken was horrible.",1

I always pay the entire balance on my credit cards each month. They told me ""oh no, leave 10 dollars on there,"" and then it begins to go downhill (later they tell me the debt-income ratio is too high because of the 10 dollars left. They had me making a minimum payment of 25 on each of my cards when the balance was only 10 dollars! It put me 50 over the limit! This doesn't even make sense.

We went in and put an offer in a property, and once we were on the hook for the 10k deposit, they backed out. Mind you, I've been fully approved by other 3 lenders, including Citi, and 2 small banks.

I had uploaded umpteen number of documents until then. The kind of proofs they were requesting were ridiculously funny to be true. E.g. They wanted me to prove that my bank account is single account and not joint!!

He was dishonest and told her that Quicken will provide a credit analyst to her to dispute inaccuracies on her credit. After he ran her information he told he couldn't help her which cause her to have a nervous breakdown and she took several different pills. That was a slap in the face for her.

Our loan process was dragged out to the very last day of our lock and we did not get documents to review until the day before closing.

Jason,"Saltillo, MS","Reviewed May 6, 2015",Recently I have been shopping for a mortgage of a new purchase. While doing this I decided to do an online chat with a Quicken Loans representative. I wanted to give him all of my info prior to applying to simply not run my credit score before I told him about my situation. After doing this I was quickly told that he would not offer me financing. His reason was that since I am employed abroad and spend 6 months a year in other countries (I am a security consultant) his company would not offer me financing. He went on to say that since I work some out of country my mortgage could not be considered my primary residence. ,1

Before I became disabled 7 years ago, I was a Senior Executive for Citi Bank, who of course owned our mortgage. With no income coming in, we lost everything of value we owned to keep a roof over our heads. Of course that is also the time the housing market crashed and we couldn't give our house away. Getting approval for Social Security Disability can take and did take several years. We had enough money to pay the mortgage, utilities and food. Once I received my disability we paid everyone we owed but our credit was already in the toilet. ",5

Now I'm convinced they did that to make it look like they were intending to grant me a loan but had no intention of doing it.

So frustrating!! The Listing agent evidently had some previous experience with Quicken and warned her Seller, even commented to the Loan Originator that none of the loans she has been involved in either closed on time or closed at all.

Kim,"Concord, OH","Reviewed Nov. 26, 2014","I did a refinance from one quicken loans loan to another one. On the initial call I was told that the costs to me for the refinance would be about $500. I went through the loan process and called back in for clarification of the numbers and was told that I would receive my current escrow back (the entire reason I called was to verify that). After we signed the papers and passed the 3 day to rescind deadline, I noticed that my old loan escrow was not being given to me. Called in to ask why and they said it was being applied to the current loan. Since that was the case I now realized I had paid $942 for the cost of the loan. I have spoken to multiple employees and their excuse on the escrow is that since they didn't say how much escrow I would get back that even if they gave me a penny they were not lying. I also argued that they used all of my escrow I didn't get any of it back. So they then changed their answer to they (conveniently) couldn't find that phone call. The use of escrow was not in the closing documents we signed either. ",1

Once going 28 days without hearing anything on my loan application, or they might call and need one Last piece of BS information and my money would soon be on its way, having told me that several times, I get a call 5 months of waiting for it to close, and they told me, my loan application had been rejected because my credit score had dropped in the five months it took to process my loan for these outstanding bills I had occurred and was going to pay the all off with my refinance. NOW my credit score has dropped to a 5.8 the worst in my entire life! As I am 62 years old and now my good credit is ruined beyond my ability to repay. I could of should of, had our local mortgage company take care of me right here in my small city in eastern Wa.

They wanted countless documents then they use to pay off debt that didn't even matter such as bank note, car loan - everything that help us build credit, they wanted it paid. We done all they said with in three days a normal bank would say yes or no you have the loan. Three weeks later after title search and appraisal, they denied the loan. $1000.00 wasted. They said debt to credit was too high. They don't keep in touch with you - only thru their Website. If you want to lose money, credit then use them. If you want to keep your money stay away from them. Your dream will turn into a nightmare, trust me it's true. It's better to use local bank for home.

Frankly I have never heard of having to pay money before any documents were signed, but since the terms of what we discussed on the phone sounded OK, I paid the money. I started reviewing the documents the next morning and immediately found that there were over 3K of fees included in the Loan and that the Loan Pay back amount was $29 more than was agreed. I have called Karlee to say I am not going forward with the loan with them and ask for my money back. Karlee never bothered to call me back so I called Quicken's Corporate Office at (800) 863-4352 and a very nice woman took care of the issue.

They did EVERYTHING they said they were going to do and I was able to stay informed through the myql.com website. I would definitely recommend them to any family member or friend looking to refinance.",5

That means three months of calling, emailing, faxing and uploading documents, and running all over town to banks, lawyers, and the courthouse. The worst thing was, they asked me to close several credit card accounts, each of which I had had for over 10 years, with flawless payment histories. My credit rating fell, literally, 80 points. During my final chat with them, they told me that they were sorry, this had never happened before (asking someone to close their accounts so early in the process, I mean), and they would make the higher-ups aware of what happened. But by reading reviews on other sites, I see it's happened to several people. I am going straight to the BBB. They shouldn't be allowed to treat people like this.",1

Charles,"Ramsey, MN","Reviewed July 7, 2014","So after reading all the bad and good reviews about QL, we decided we were going to focus on the positive. About 28 days later, our loan was ready closed by Aaron ** and his team from QL. He was very truthful to us, return all my calls and assured me to wait till the end and see what a wonderful experience we would have. Even though we had some issue with our credit which was taken care of, they were quick to address all the concerns on our credit. All I will say is, do your part on responding to documents requested on a timely bases, return calls, ask for clarification and above all be patient. We are very happy to be one of those who had a good experience with the QL family. I will say this to you, do not focus on the bad reviews. Others who may have submitted those reviews had their experience base on their credit information and other qualification that may be different from yours. If it does not work with QL, there is a reason for it, take your blame and stop discouraging others to try. With the policies that government has put in place, I don't think a company like QL will be out to steal your deposit money. Be aware of those other mortgage companies who may have being putting bad reviews for QL in order to get your business. My name is Charles and I am a living testimony for an Amazing experience with QL.",5

Charlie,"Augusta, WV","Reviewed July 2, 2014","Recently, I received a phone call from your company, Quicken Loans, with an option to refinance my home. The cost of the refi was extremely low and the terms of the loan were very good so I accepted the offer. After several days of emailing and photo copying documents, I was told everything was in order and Quicken requested a Good Faith Deposit, to show that I was truly interested in the loan. Having been a long time user of the Quicken Loans with several good experiences, I accepted the offer and gave my credit card number so they could proceed with the loan. Several days later I received a phone call telling me that my loan was not approved because my home value was too high. Apparently there is a law in West Virginia that restricts loans due to this reason. My first statement to the agent was when do I get my deposit back?! She said I would have to speak to another representative at which time I was transferred and told by another agent that they would review it and call me back.

We asked to be run for a conventional loan several times and the agent kept trying to push us towards FHA before they finally began the process of running us for conventional. Initially they told my husband his mid credit score was too low and to pay off $1600 worth of stuff to improve it to be considered. After we did that and they sent out a company to do the appraisal. They not only compared the house to a short sale, but put down the wrong square footage for the house we were buying which caused the appraisal to come back $17K less than what we bought the house for.

Miguel,"Saint Johns, FL","Reviewed April 28, 2014","Having received several ads from Quicken, I finally thought I might inquire about a refinance. I contacted an agent and was overwhelmed with warmth and fuzziness. I just made a new best friend. Having gone over some of the details, I decided I would mull things over and call back in a few days. During that time, I just happened to stumble on some Quicken reviews. They, for the most part, were not complimentary to say the least which made me apprehensive. When I called back to inform the agent that I had decided to forgo doing a refinance, they turned into being not so friendly and actually sounded (to me) angry with my decision. Then I was barraged with scripted one-liners like ""The ship is leaving the dock and you are going to miss it"". Then I got a curt ""Have a nice day"" and they simply hung up. A few days later, a new bubbly friend called and said they could help me. I said I had no intention of doing business with them and that was it. I am glad I read the reviews before getting further involved.",1

L. H.,"Detroit, MI","Reviewed April 17, 2014","I'll condense this to save space & time. I sent out a request on the internet for a refinance loan on my house. Quicken Loans was the first to respond and after hearing an excellent sales pitch I signed up. The first requirement was an up-front deposit of $400. This was to be refunded if the loan could not be made. The final package was they were going to give me a loan for $24,000 but, they had to pay off my car @ a little over $12,000. I was going to actually receive a little over $7,000. I said $12,000 and $7,000 is $19,000; that leaves almost $5,000. For what? Closing costs. They were going to write me a 30-year loan for $24,000 @ over 5% interest and all I was going to see was $7,000 plus. I told them to forget it and requested a refund of my deposit. ""Oh! That was used for the Credit Report and Appraisal. Your refund is only $10.76"". So, it cost me almost $400 and over three weeks of providing endless requests for financial documents, for nothing.",1

My debt to income ratio was an issue, but they identified two accounts that I would need to pay off and close, in order to qualify. I closed one of them, but said I needed to be sure the refinance was going to be approved before I would close the second account.

Then, they said the zoning on the buildings was grandfathered in, which we knew (ALL of that town is on some zoning variance, since the buildings are all old and the zoning ordinances have been changed very recently). Since the point of the zoning change was to remove the ability to rebuilt multifamily housing (town is desperate to gentrify), they will not extend the grandfathering to rebuilding if the current structure is destroyed. This does not affect the insurability of the mortgage, since the insurance is assigned to satisfy the mortgage amount first. If the zoning was that important that it would preclude the ability to refinance under any circumstances, WHY was that not checked after we spent the FIRST $500? Because they wanted the second $500. Oh, and they claim to have spent more than $500 apiece on the appraisals, so not even a token refund. DO NOT USE QUICKEN unless you are certain that zoning is pristine.",1

When it was insufficient, they cancelled, then reinstated after I told them the error... Now they cancelled again because the property doesn't qualify even though I told them in the beginning what the property was and the residence was not the most valuable piece. The income is more than sufficient but so far I have lost the down payment I made. Perhaps, they only make money from forfeited down payments instead!!!!!!",1

And all they seemed to do is ask for more and more information, with no intentions of giving me a loan. I question their ability, their desire to be of assistance and whether or not they were following company directives and protocol. Perhaps I should be thankful for their ineptness as it served me well in the long run.

Thomas,"New York, NY","Reviewed Aug. 25, 2013","I applied through Quicken Loans for a lender that would give me a personal loan for $2k.

I wrote two separate emails refusing this loan and its terms and they called me about 4 times to contact them to sign the loan papers.

They refuse to adjust escrow based on the amount owed which is zero. They say they can't do it but then adjust escrow down a few dollars by changing the way they compute escrow.

Roger,"Glen Allen, VA","Reviewed June 11, 2013",I paid $400 to Quicken Loans towards refinancing my current mortgage. Quicken Loans called this payment a good faith payment on my part that will be credited towards my mortgage if it goes through or refunded in case mortgage is not approved or if I want to withdraw from the process at any time for any reason. Quicken Loans' advertising says that there is NO appraisal required and NO income verification needed. Quicken Loans told me I need to have the house appraised. The person on the phone estimated that the appraisal could cost $250. So I frankly and clearly told Quicken Loans over the phone that I do not want to pay for any appraisal fees or any other fees other than the credit report check.,1

However, I have paperwork that says how much the appraisal is ($240.00) and it does not add up to $400.00. They refuse to give any credit due. Also, the appraisal was much lower than VA appraisal 3 years ago. The appraisal took foreclosure homes amounts, which lowered our home amount $54,000.00. They claim this was the government that decided to include appraisals on foreclosure homes. Quicken Loans is a scam. Please don't trust this company.",1

They told me my credit score was lower than it is. I know this because I had just obtained it from all three reporting agencies. I have 0% financing on my vehicle because of my credit. The gentlemen I spoke with was not in any way helpful. I was of the opinion that this would be a quick and easy way to gauge my options. The gentleman ran my credit (mind you, I have had good to excellent credit for more than 20 years) and then came back on the phone and told me I had no options with them.

Quicken has been calling me daily to offer me a better rate through refinance with a 'free' closing. I was even told the appraisal is part of closing costs and I would have no cost! I had a GMAC loan which was transferred to OCWEN in Feb. 2013. 30 days prior to the takeover, I received a 'legally required' 30 days’ notice of the transfer from GMAC. The transition was seamless and my autopay had no disruption. Now, Quicken is calling claiming that they are managing my loan and in 1 to 2 months I will be making payments to Quicken anyway, so I may as well refinance for a better rate! The representative came just short of calling me crazy and stupid when I told him I'd discuss the refinance with my husband!

So this was what I was looking for since my current loan is an FHA and I'm tired of paying a PMI so I wanted out. He offered me a rate of 3.75% which is lower than the current 4.875% and I wanted cash out so I can do some upgrades to the house.

Interesting that the mortgage broker does not mention this during the initial consultation, but it is written in the fine print.

What really makes me mad is that I had sent them all the documents relating to income and debt the second day I talked to them. Why did it take them three weeks to tell me my debt-to-income ratio was too high? Why not tell me that the second or third day of the loan process?

They asked me for a ""good faith deposit"" of $400 to secure the loan. After going through a lot of paperwork and submitting documents I questioned they needed, they finally called back and said they needed to set up an appraisal and they needed $475 to pay for it. I told them the IRRRL loans don't need an appraisal. They said they require one. I said, ""What if the appraisal comes in lower than the amount owed?"" They said then they couldn't do the loan and I would lose my non-refundable appraisal fee. After I heard that, I told them I didn't want to proceed with the loan and I wanted my good faith deposit, at which time I was advised I would get back the deposit less the credit fees that would be taken out.

In the end, he quoted me $2900 for closing cost and asked for my credit card for the appraisal. I asked that he send the estimates to me via email so I could compare. He fired back somewhat angrily, “The quote is $2900. That's all you need and the rate changes daily not just interest rates.” Oh, the used-car sales tactic - pressure - “Hurry or it will be gone offer,” “Only good today,” “I have others looking at it.” I am so scared! I left it with he'll call me back tomorrow and is expecting me to hand over my C number. Joke’s on him. I eat high-pressure sales people for lunch.

Thomas,"Pawling, NY","Reviewed Oct. 22, 2012","This process began on August 6, 2012. It is now October 22, 2012 and we are no closer to closing. The last rate lock extension expired this past Saturday, October 20, 2012. This was the third time such extension was required due to failure on their part to close this refinance. I was asked to continually supply documentation even though I had both faxed and uploaded the information with a confirmation. The closing costs continued to rise. A large portion of them were relating to taxes coming due. Because of the delays, the taxes were paid by my current servicer, but the closing costs only dropped by a small amount. Quicken Loans has locked a higher rate on this, even though they failed to close on time and their rate offerings to others have dropped.",1

The guy was good, very fast and took a lot of information. At one point in our conversation, he told me that because I was a disabled veteran (after thanking me for my service to our country) that Quicken would waive the VA funding fee (2.5%). After asking for $400 upfront to continue, I told him that I was going to shop around to see what other rates I could find. He said he understood and thanked me for calling. I then went on the VA.gov site to see what info they had. I found that the VA Funding Fee is waived by the VA for Vets getting disability. I then got an email detailing two 30-year loans with and without points. It looked very attractive. I sent him an email back thanking him.

Michael,"El Paso , TX","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2012","Having read a lot of these comments about Quicken, I figured I put my 2 cents in about my experience. My situation seems to have been a bit different. I was looking to refinance to get lower payment and overall lower interest, even if I had to extend back to 30 years. I have been in the house for 8 now. I paid my $400 upfront like everyone else. The appraiser came in and gave the house a value of over $20,000 higher than the central appraisal district thinks it is worth (for tax purposes) so that was good. The actual closing itself was fine as well, no issues with any of the paperwork.",2

Joel,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed Aug. 14, 2012","We bought up the loan and paid a higher interest rate in exchange for a $1225 lender credit. At time of closing, our credit had been reduced by over $400. This was without any notice. Being that Quicken Loans changed the terms of our loan, we refused to close the loan. They then attempted to keep our $500 deposit. We went to our credit card and obtained a refund of this charge. Quicken Loans was very unhelpful and it took many, many emails and phone calls and different people to even get someone who could attempt to help us resolve this. Quicken Loans stated they give no notice when a lender credit is reduced. You only find this out at closing time. Having completed many loans, I was shocked by the actions of Quicken Loans and their bait and switch tactics. I would strongly advise thinking twice before using them. And if you do decide to go that route, then double and triple check your numbers. There are many other options out there for lenders. Choose wisely.",1

The reps. were not friendly when I tried to get some answers, so I told them I would not close. They tried to convince me that the closing was reasonable.

I was assured repeatedly that if the appraisal came on target, I would get the loan since I had already been approved.

I was informed that I would need to pay a $400.00 in good faith payment to proceed, but this amount would be applied towards my loan. I uncomfortably agreed. I asked multiple times as to if this was a ""no money down"" loan and was assured it was. However, during the course of the information gathering and the agent running my credit, he would now and again change the definition of a ""no money down"" refinance. I was informed my credit and income were excellent, and he saw no problems and would get this shipped off to underwriting for immediate approval. I asked if it was going to cost me anything more than the $400.00 I had already paid and was told ""Well, we may need you to come up with an additional $735.00 to prepay 6 months of taxes and insurance but they might be able to roll it into the loan.""

We were informed by Ryan ** that this was a streamlined process and we would benefit if we locked in the low interest rate with a $400 good faith deposit. Quicken Loans sent out their appraiser.

Needless to say, I was very frustrated and had to forget working with Quicken on the refinance.

Linda,"Lemon Cove, CA","Reviewed Feb. 6, 2012","We tried to get a low-interest refinance through Quicken. We are retired, so we were concerned about our income being a problem. We were assured it would not be a problem in getting a loan. In the end, after several weeks of back and forth we were informed that our income-to-debt ratio was not enough for a 30-year fixed rate even though we had never missed a payment in 5 years. But they would happily give us a 7-year loan for a lower interest rate. Our concern was that if interest rates went up in 7 years, we would be worse off and not be able to qualify for any refinance. They still tried to talk us out onto this ledge. All we ended up doing was having to pay a fee for processing. If they had been up front about the ratio, we would not have incurred any fees. What a rip off.",1
Mary,"Little Rock, AR","Reviewed Feb. 5, 2012","I was looking to refinance my home with cash out for debt consolidation. Initially, the person I talked to was very nice. I faxed all the materials they requested and paid the good faith deposit of $400 (had to put off a couple bills to do it!). They sent an appraiser who was not from the area. She used comps that were not in my neighborhood and what do you know! My appraisal was $18,000 less that the appraisal done a year and a half before, and therefore, the loan would not go through! I called and complained about this but to no avail. I requested my money back but they said it all went to the appraiser. When I talked to the same person again he was very rude and condescending to me! Then to twist the knife further, sent me a letter thanking me and hoping they could be of service to me in the future! I feel like I should be wearing a sign that says ""I'm a sucker! All scam artists welcome! This all happened in the midst of a heartbreaking year for me (family and financial loss).

At first, there was no money required down to finance then the appraisal came back just a little over what the house needed to be refinanced for. So they said they had to raise my rate just a bit but the monthly amount wouldn't be affected that much and closing costs would be about $3900.

This was true, but life had to continue. So, while I waited I started my remodel. Then, Ed finally gets back to me to schedule an in-home appraisal. Usually, in the past, these were done as drive-bys, if at all. Well the appraiser came in, marked me as not having a functional bathroom.

I come to find out, they appraised it for just enough to be able to give me the loan. Then when I received the paperwork, there was a $6500 fee in the PMI line of the documents. I called and asked about it because VA loans aren't subject to PMI and the Quicken rep told me it was a VA penalty.

Rebecca,"Spirit Lake, IA","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2011","Working with Quicken loans was a mistake. I had been online using a mortgage calculator to see if I would benefit from a refinance. The next day, Anthony from Quicken contacted me and let me know of an amazing deal he could work out for me. He would be able to cut my interest rate by 2.5% and cut a year off the life of my loan. Sounded like a great deal. I told him of my concern about an appraisal because of some foreclosures in the area and how that would bring my value down. He was very persuasive in assuring me that he felt I wouldn't have any issues with the value of my home. Then, he asked me for a credit card so he could charge $400 for good faith fees. He completely let me believe this money would be refunded as soon as the deal was complete. I asked him if this money would be refunded no matter the outcome. Well, our appraisal, just as I had concerned, came back too low. Now our great deal couldn't be done.",1
Stephanie,"Troy, VA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2011","My husband and I contacted Quicken Loans for a refinance on our house. We were looking for a lower interest rate so our monthly payment would be lowered. After talking to our current lender (who couldn't match Quicken Loan), we decided to go with Quicken loans. Big, big mistake! After sending them the same documents multiple times and giving them 400.00 in ""good faith money"", they ordered an appraisal which comes in way too low for my area. Since the appraisal came in low, we couldn't have a VA loan and Jamil said he would try to get a Fannie Mae loan. That is when the calls stopped. I always had to call him. On Sept. 6, 2011, I called Jamil again which goes to a voicemail. I finally got a call back and told that I was denied a loan. I asked about my $400.00. I was told the appraisal was $400.00 and credit report was $18.50, implying I owed them money. There should be a class action lawsuit against this company.

Quicken makes you feel confident, rush you into paying the $500.00, then essentially take that $500 for themselves.

We were initially asking for $417,000. We locked a rate of 4.25% with 1.625 points and I provided the $500.00 they requested. Unfortunately, the appraisal came in much lower than I had hoped, so rate offer and points offer would no longer be valid. This made sense to me. Although I must admit, I was extremely disappointed with the appraised value and to this day, felt it was significantly lower than it should have been. But I understood the reality of today’s declining market with declining home values. On April 30th, Christopher told me that the maximum amount we could borrow was $356,000. Although it was lower than what we wanted, we figured it would be sufficient. ",N/A

They said they had the best rates/service, etc. I paid them $500 (only company that requires this). They did an appraisal which cost them $300. The same day, I found several other lenders willing to offer me the identical (term, payment, rate, etc) refinance mortgage for several thousands of dollars less. I told Quicken I wasn't to proceed with their refinance mortgage. The new lender just required them to release my appraisal (which I paid for) and they can enter their name as lender instead of Quicken. Joe **, from the President's office, told me that since I decided not to proceed with them, they won't release MY appraisal or refund my $500. They're keeping my appraisal and money.

We proceeded with the loan application which included 7 pages of of documentation which he e-mailed me during the conversion. He instructed me to scroll down the bottom of each page and electronically sign them. When he asked me for $500, I asked if I could send a check. He said no, that he needed a credit card. I told him I was concerned about losing it. He assured me It would be applied to my closing cost and they need the $500 to get the appraisal.

                                    I was pre-approved for $229,000.  My father-in-law, who is a realtor, took us on a tour of different homes in our price range and area.  We came across one that we fell in love with.  Our realtor/father-in-law was agast at the great deal the home was.  It turned out the person selling the home in Minnesota had to pack up and move to California.  He had lowered the home from $259,000 to $229,500.  We put down an offer of $227,500 and he took it.
                                
                            
                                
                                    We were overjoyed, our father-in-law was overjoyed, even Quicken Loans seemed excited.  We were about to get the home of our dreams for a great deal in the area we wanted to live.  Dream come true.
                                
                            
                                
                                    Then came the appraisal.  Quicken Loans called us and told us the home was in a declining market area and we would now have to put down at least 5% at closing.  5% is $11,800 more than we had figured on.  Quicken knew we didn't have this money, as we had been sending them our checking account info, and other financial documents.Even my realtor father-in-law was thrown back.  He has been in real estate for 20 years and he's never seen anything like Quicken's deal.  He told us he wouldn't let us buy a place if he felt it was going to decline in value.What Quicken didn't know was that our father-in-law was giving us his 3% commission.  So, I told them 5% might be a doable amount, I now only had to come up with about $4500, which I planned on borrowing from my parents.  This wasn't good news for Quicken, who quickly told us that the 5% must come solely from me and not from a gift of any sort.  I told them I would sell my parents my left shoe for $4500 and my father-in-law my right shoe for his 3% commission, then I would have earned the money myself.  They would have no part of that.
                                
                            
                                
                                    What kind of company has anyone ever worked with where they ask you where you got the money?  The mortgage company wasn't worried about whether we could make our payments, just about this 5% down payment.  If I got the money from a sale on Ebay, is that really important to them?  It's not a concern at a car dealer or any other business if I tell them I have $11,800 in my back pocket.  It's none of their business where it came from.
                                
                            
                                
                                    Anyway, all of this appraisal information came to us exactly 5 days before we were to close.  We are now scrambling with other mortgage lenders in hopes of someone latching on to us.

The home had a deck, a room that could be converted into another bedroom or an office by adding a carpet and a closet, and a new walking trail was built that leads up to our backyard.

Once my realtor and I found some we got the ball rolling on it.  A couple days later Freddie's boss, Reginald, called me and informed me that the loan is not good on manufactued homes, and that I would be refunded my deposit.

Since Quicken was an online company, we weren't sure if they had somebody that we needed to use, so we asked, we were told to use whoever the seller wants.  Our realtor said that it does not work like that and asked for Neha to call her, she did call and still did not know what she was talking about.  When I talked to Neha, I finally figured out that we needed to get a lawyer for the title search. In the next couple of weeks we received about 4 or 5 different settlement costs.  We did consider points, but told Neha we did not want to do points, so she included them anyway and tacked on more fees, which she told us to ignore.  Our attorney said that you can't ignore it.  At this time we were trying to get our mortgage commitment, my husband asked Neha for this and she said that she didn't know what we meant.  So, again were doing her job for her by finding out what she needs to do and calling her.  Our attorney tried to contact her and at first she was not responsive, she was also angry with me and would not respond towards me either.  She eventually talked to our attorney and told him she has us locked in at a rate that we knew about (we did not know this up front because she gave us a different rate when we first talked to her and didn't lock us in until a few weeks later at a higher rate).  He asked her for the mortgage commitment then, and she said she would e-mail it to him, but didn't send it to him or my husband or I.

Well, during this conversation he snickered at me and asked why we didn't call him, I said that he told me that Neha was our contact.  Then he said we should talk to him, when I wanted some information he said that we should talk to Neha, I eventually told him that I don't want to deal with her.  All that he could do was defend her.  By the end of the conversation with Paul, he was telling me that our attorney makes up our settlement costs and that Quicken only has about $600 in fees.  My husband and I were tired of this so we dropped them and went somewhere else with better fees and of course, will not be seeing our $500 deposit.  Since then, I have e-mailed Paul that we weren't using them and told him why.  He has forwarded that e-mail to Neha and she has basically accused me of getting mixed up and blamed me, but when she wasn't doing her job, she didn't have any response why.  She has also told us that our realtor and our lawyer has lied to us and they are just looking for a commission, while she gets nothing but her regular pay.  It's pretty scary going for a mortgage when the mortgage broker your talking to has no clue who does the title search, who makes up settlement costs, and what a mortgage commitment is.

Donald,"Woodbridge, VA","Reviewed Dec. 23, 2006","I was led to believe, at first, that I could reduce my current monthly mortgage payment by $1,100!  The nature of John P's spiel was ""DO IT NOW!"",  ""DON'T LET THIS OPPORTUNITY GET AWAY FROM YOU!""  ""WHILE THE RATES ARE LOW!""

The $1,100 ""promise"" later dropped to ""about $1,000. then, it was ""we will surely do SOMETHING for you, don't worry"". ",N/A

Eugene,"Decatur, GA","Reviewed July 21, 2006","This is in regards to a recent application for a second mortgage, and refinance of a first mortgage, initiated by your employee, Nick ********.  I was very reluctant with proceeding with the application; however, Mr. ******** made it seem as if he wouldn't know what I would actually qualify for - unless I proceeded with the processing by paying a $750 deposit.  The deposit verbiage contradicted with Mr. ********’ translation. He assured me that the deposit was refundable, should I decide not to proceed with the loan. If you record your phone conversations, as do most financial institutions, you will hear him state that. I cancelled the process within 24 hours, as my bank offered a more favorable solution that Quicken could not. ",N/A

He measured my house 20 square feet smaller than previous appraisals done on this home.  The house next door to me was being appraised the same day by a different company.

Gregg,"Oak Grove, MO","Reviewed July 10, 2006", I contacted Quicken Loans for a refinance on my second mortgage. After speaking to a representative and making a decision to go forward I was asked to provide $500 to them to pay for the processing of my loan which would be deducted from the $1700 closing costs. They clearly stated that should the loan not go through or if I changed my mind that the $500 would be refunded immediately. At that point I provided them with my Providian Visa account number and they made the charge.  It should be clearly noted that prior to making my decision to proceed that Quicken loans ran a credit check. After they received the report they clearly indicated that my FICO score was 690-plus and I was more than qualified for the refinance.  ,N/A
