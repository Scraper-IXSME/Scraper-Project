Tesa,"Braham, MN","Reviewed July 1, 2023","I had quite a difficult process with AmeriSave because I was in the process of a divorce and had some credit issues. So, I needed to submit a couple of times things like bank statements, work stubs and payment stubs. The reps needed to check my credit a couple of times to make sure the numbers were right or the debt-to-income ratio was correct. But they were wonderful about walking me through it and working with me throughout the process. AmeriSave’s website was user-friendly. It was very obvious what action steps needed to be taken from the website but oftentimes, it did not reflect what my agent was saying. She would tell me something was due and needed, but the website would say that I was fully done and everything was submitted. So there was a little bit of confusion on that. But otherwise, the website was very user-friendly. ",4
Mike,"Richland, MI","Reviewed April 5, 2023","A rep named Russell called me and he seemed like a really nice gentleman. He was really positive and wasn't pushy. I told him what I was doing and he said AmeriSave could help me. He ran some numbers really quickly and he's like, “Here's what you're looking at.” He cut right to the chase. He didn't get through all the bread and the fluff. he told me the rates and the closing cost. I was interested and I pursued it from there.",5
Darrin,"Coon Rapids, MN","Reviewed Feb. 19, 2023","I was looking at cash-out refinance options that were military and AmeriSave was rated one of the best companies that did that. I did a cash-out refinance with them. The process started off pretty well. Carlo was the loan originator that I was working with and he did an outstanding job. He was really friendly and consistent with communication. He kept me up to speed on certain aspects of the process, how long things took, and things to watch out for. ",4
Laura,"Dayton, OH","Reviewed Jan. 6, 2023","The first person that I talked to at AmeriSave was very pushy in wanting my credit information. But I said I was looking for guidance and I was not looking to lock anything in yet because I still got to get through the repair. She was taken back a little bit and then made me feel like, “Okay. If you're not serious, I really don't wanna deal with you” kind of thing. I spent years in real estate, so I understand.",5
Kim,"Freedom, PA","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2022","I was Googling some of the best refinance companies in the region. I wanted to find a good refinance company and not a mediocre one. I wanted somebody with excellent customer service. AmeriSave was one of the few that were up there along with Quicken Loans. I already went through Quicken Loans before and they they quoted me so low on the house. That ticked me off. My husband and I did a major renovation and after that, tried out AmeriSave. I'm happy I did. The online application process was very straightforward and user-friendly. At first, there was a little bit of a hiccup because it wasn't accepting my username and password. It was explained to us ahead of time that that could happen because of some type of glitch in their system. That was not a big deal and we got over it.",5
Marshall,"Ray City, GA","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023","The portal where I submitted documents was a little disjointed to use. Other than that, the application process was easy and the rep stayed in contact. If I had a question or sent an email, I got feedback pretty quickly. Also, we had an issue toward closing. I had submitted pay stubs but only one went through. So, it looked like I had half the income I should have had. We were doing an addition to our home and I said, “No. I wanted to cash out so I can pay for this remodel.” When they looked at my income, they said,  “Oh, we're missing half your pay because we don't have the pay stubs.” So, I had to resubmit. But they corrected everything on their end. That just delayed the process a week or so which was not a big deal.",4
Tiffany,"Henrico, VA","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023","The Amerisave rep that contacted me at first was really thorough and would always answer the phone when I had questions. The application process was relatively easy. I only had a bit of a glitch at the end trying to get some paperwork from my condo. But once I called and got that and they released it to me, it went relatively quickly. Other than that, everything was still done in a timely manner. They also did a good job of explaining and emailing me, letting me know I had a new form to fill out.",5
Anita,"Ormond Beach, FL","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023","Amerisave was phenomenal. The rep I worked with had to get on the phone for hours with me, just trying to get through the program safely. They had a decent title company come and close it. They had an appraiser come out. It was local. They did everything a mortgage company should do. Everything worked out fine.",5
Christina,"Brunswick, GA","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023",The process at AmeriSave was very easy. The application was very self-explanatory. Their customer service was very good. The payment is easy to manage and the ability to take some equity out of the home to pay off other debts was amazing.,5
Srinivasa,"Midland, MI","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023",AmeriSave was very responsive and quick in returning back to my calls. The application was quick too. The rep I worked with was very courteous. He had been always on top of things and called me back sometimes. He got that going right from the time I wanted him to start the process. He was knowledgeable and was able to answer every question I had.,5
Victor,"Williston, ND","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023","The process with Amerisave worked out well. It was also quick. The rates were good too. The reps were very professional and helpful, especially James. It was my first time, so it was a lot of stuff that I didn't knew. And he walked me through it. I'm really satisfied with Amerisave.",5
Connie,"Mulberry Grove, IL","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023","The original person did the paperwork for approval and was initially nice, but things got out of hand and she didn't disclose things that she should have had like manually underwriting things. That's a big deal compared to a regular underwrite. I didn't know that and that posed a lot of challenges. There was also lack of communication on documents that were required. I would send Amerisave what they asked me for, then they would come back and tell me that was not acceptable. It was a complete nightmare. I've done a lot of FHA loans and this has been by far the worst.",2
Rodney,"Fleetwood, PA","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023","I was doing a refinance mortgage with AmeriSave and the application process was very simple. As soon as I called, I got ahold of a broker and he walked me through the steps. It was effortless and I loved it. Overall, the whole process took about two months since I had a lot of stuff that I had to gather up being that I'm on disability. I liked the promptness of my rep in returning my calls and the explanation of everything that he gave. I was also pleased with rate and terms of my refinance.",5
Andrew,"Albany, MN","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2023",AmeriSave was nice to work with. It's been the easiest process ever that I've ever had with a loan. The online portal is the way to go. They told us every piece of information we had to download on there and it was quick. The communication was awesome.,5
Tydarryl,"Saint Louis, MO","Reviewed Aug. 14, 2023","The application process with AmeriSave was long because I jumped the gun. In the beginning, I was real confident that I had everything. But as the process was going on, my confidence kind of waivered, because it was taking so long and I still gotta make payments towards other things because it was not happening as fast as I wanted it to. There was a lot of going back and forth with paperwork I had to submit and then, the underwriter needed more information as opposed to the actual application process.",5
Kristina,"Lithia Springs, GA","Reviewed Aug. 14, 2023","The initial experience was good, but then we got transferred from our loan originator to our loan processor and she was not very responsive. It ended up causing us to be a week behind. We didn't have to push our closing date back, but there was a lot of stuff that we had to scramble to get in last minute because she apparently went on vacation when she was given our file. Overall, it was a good experience aside from that one hiccup. I was satisfied with the rate as well. We ended up getting 6.7%, which right now, is not terrible from what I've come to be told.",4
Melinda,"Oxford, MS","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2023","The loan officer was awesome. It didn't matter if it was past working time, he was gonna do what he had to to get things done. I really appreciated it. It was helpful with somebody that didn't know all the ins and outs of everything. He ended up finding a way to go around without using my income because the lady wouldn't do what I needed done. He worked with us and we got it all done. Amerisave went above and beyond.",5
Paulette,"Rumford, ME","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2023","I was very pleased with AmeriSave from beginning to end. The reps were very informative and kept me informed of every process. I dealt with Matthew in the beginning and then, Christopher, and the communication was excellent. I'm very happy with the rate, especially when I look online today. AmeriSave should keep up the good work. They're great. They informed me that my mortgage would be serviced by another company, which does happen.",5
Roger,"Secaucus, NJ","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2023","It was a great experience working with AmeriSave Mortgage. Spoke to one of the loan officers. He walked me through everything, sent me some e-documents to sign. He was nice, knowledgeable, and willing to help with anything. Everything was very easy. They worked with me on everything. Fast turnaround. I was surprised. The rate and terms are in line with everything that's going on.",5
Shannalla,"Quinton, AL","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2023",The refinancing process with AmeriSave was very slow. I almost left and didn't go through with it. It was just getting flood insurance and it was very long. I have financed probably four houses in my lifetime and it was the worst experience. It was almost two months. But the rate and terms are alright and I plan on getting refinanced the next year.,3
Keith,"Indianapolis, IN","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","My first experience with AmeriSave was great. The rate in terms were excellent. The salesperson was excellent. She was timely, and she got back with things right away. Things moved really smoothly. After she did her work, it ran into a mud puddle and it slowed way down. They requested things over and over again. The underwriters would request things they already had because they weren't paying attention to the fact they already had it. You could never talk to the underwriter. It got weighty then because they were opposite of the saleslady who we met with first. They could have looked to see what they had in their file before they requested it. We submitted exact same things multiple times.",3
John,"West Bloomfield, MI","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","I had a good conversation with Daniel, the guy that was my mortgage lender with AmeriSave. He was very helpful and very understanding about what my situation was. Based on our conversations, I thought he would do a good job. I told Daniel what my situation was and what my constraints were. He looked at it and told me what he could do. He went step by step in terms of what we needed to do, what we could do, and what my parameters were so that I could look for a place. It didn't take long for Daniel to get me pre-qualified. But for me to find a place took several months. In the end, I got a fair price, given the constraints of the mortgage industry at that point in time with the interest rate.",5
Craig,"Tyler, TX","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","Our rep from AmeriSave, Matthew, was awesome. The only difficult time was dealing with the underwriters, but it was just trying to get documents. Everything went fine, but everything was rushed at the last minute. I wasn't upset about it. It's just a little frustrating. Underwriting could have been a little quicker. We didn't know if we were approved until the day before we closed on the house. Other than that, it was perfect. Interest rates are high, but everything worked out.",5
Lonnie,"Jackson, TN","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","AmeriSave has a great process. It was simple. Someone immediately called me and we got started. When I had any questions or concerns, they were right on it. If I had a problem, I just call and they would answer and it would be resolved. I like that they kept in constant contact. They were impressive. Their rates were in line with everything, too. I would highly recommend them.",5
John,"Griffith, IN","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","I called some number and they appointed AmeriSave. I spoke with them and they gave me a rate. I went with them and the application process was good. I was approved in under a week. If I had any questions, customer service answered them right away. Everything was transparent. If there were any updates, they kept me updated right away. ",5
Garry,"Waurika, OK","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","Everybody was good though a few times, the experience with AmeriSave got stressful. The whole process took a while but I understood that.",4
Linda,"Austin, TX","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","The process with AmeriSave was quite easy. They ask for the paperwork and you give it to them. They do their background checks and you do your checks. You do your numbers and they do their numbers. Then, you go to signing. Jonathan, the rep, is gonna answer your questions even if it's 9 o'clock at night. When I told him I didn’t like something, he either answered my questions or got it resolved. People should go with AmeriSave and try to find him. The rate and terms were competitive. At the time, I did some work online to see what the rate should be at this point. And that's what I got.",5
Marissa,"Newport News, VA","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","AmeriSave requested the entire copy of my divorce paperwork but it could be the lender that AmeriSave worked with. I had a legal name change and that was a little evasive because I've been divorced for almost three years now. But other than that, I don't have any complaints. Tim, the rep, was great and I had a good experience with AmeriSave. It was quick and easy. The rate and the terms were better than what had been offered elsewhere. I wanna refinance my house when I got divorced. My rate was 3.25 and they got me 5.25. But the whole rates in the country are not great right now. That's lower than what I've seen elsewhere. Other people had quoted me up to 9%, which is insane because I have good credit.",4
Mike,"Estacada, OR","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2023","Without the guy who helped me, Daniel, the application process with AmeriSave seemed a little difficult. But with this help, it was easy. Daniel was really good. If I called and he wasn't able to answer, he was able to call me right back. And we worked through all the paperwork to get it done.",5
Duane,"Thousand Oaks, CA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2023",The refi was easy to get through. The whole process was two to three weeks.,5
Thomas,"Gig Harbor, WA","Reviewed July 31, 2023","The woman that I initially talked to was not only extremely helpful, but answered questions quickly. And she had a good response time. That, coupled with some of the rates and some of the overall numbers, is why I chose AmeriSave Mortgage. There were occasional times when some of the progress got bogged down by systems. But most of the process was easy and streamlined. They did a great job.",5
Napoleon,"Stone Mountain, GA","Reviewed July 29, 2023",It has been a pleasure to work with AmeriSave Mortgage. They gathered some information about me and processed the loan accordingly. Everything went nice and smooth. It was easy compared to several loan process that I've been through before. Everything was simple and to the point. They were fair with the loan terms and rate. I'm fairly happy with the way everything worked out. Give them a try.,5
Michael,"Maple Heights, OH","Reviewed July 28, 2023","The first contact person that I had with AmeriSave was Ben and he told me, “I understand what you're saying. It's been on your credit file for all of these. But we can do a little bit better than the cash-out offered.” So he directed me into things that I needed to do. The only problem I have in that was there were other people that were directly involved in this process, and each one of them had a different role in doing this. In the beginning, I didn't understand it because I thought I was gonna be doing business with Ben. But he did say to me that there were gonna be other people. I was reluctant into that because I'm dealing with one person and he's telling me somebody else from another organization that's affiliated with what he does. It was a bit too much for me to swallow. ",5
Anthony,"Waynetown, IN","Reviewed July 28, 2023","My application process for a new mortgage with AmeriSave went smoothly, which took two weeks. The communication was good.",4
R,"Albuquerque, NM","Reviewed July 23, 2023","Getting my mortgage was initially fine but the closure process was a mess. They were very disorganized. We almost missed the closing date due to their failure to review my paperwork errors and changes. We were two weeks from closing and they still hadn't done any of the paperwork that needed to be done for that, My realtor and I were calling them every few hours to tell them, ""We're closing in two days. You haven't provided us with the paperwork."" They have very little transparency on the final loan approval and making paperwork available to titleholders and the closing people. Plus, they were constantly shuffling the work between different people and finding the person working on it was extremely difficult. ",2
Damon,"Florissant, MO","Reviewed July 22, 2023","My loan officer was pretty cool. But when my wife and I did some digging, we found out that I bought my interest rate for $15,000 and we didn't like that. I knew something wasn't right about the interest rate that we got, and we couldn't understand why we were paying cost because we were already living there. That wasn't shown to us either. Amerisave should disclose everything that’s on the table for the buyer, like if they don’t qualify for a good rate, they should let them know. But everything else was pretty cool. All the agents were great.",3
Angie,"Rossville, GA","Reviewed July 22, 2023",It was great with AmeriSave. Both of the people that we talked to were fabulous.,5
Eric,"Riverdale, IL","Reviewed July 22, 2023",The reps gave me a lot of knowledge about the loan. They were on their game. The rate wasn't bad at all and the terms were good. I totally agree with it. People should look into AmeriSave and give it a shot.,5
Darrin,"Bayville, NJ","Reviewed July 21, 2023","Applying with AmeriSave was easy. They asked for a few documents and I already had everything so it was not a problem getting them anything. My wife keeps good records of everything. The application and underwriting process took under two weeks. Everything was pretty much good. AmeriSave was helpful. They asked me for what they needed from me and I got what they needed. If there were any problems, they called me. I got it taken care of and it was good. ",5
Wally,"Kenosha, WI","Reviewed July 21, 2023","I was working on a refinance with them. The loan officer was unable to do simple math and forecast if the loan was even viable. He gave bad information and couldn't even get the address of the property right. In the end they came back and tried to give me a loan on a partial refinance. They wanted to give me a 7.5% loan to replace a 4.25% loan that didn't even come close to achieving the results asked for in the beginning. It would have added $10,000 to the loan and been more expensive than my original loan. Then they pressed to try and close immediately. Completely unethical company. I would avoid them at all cost.",1
Beverly,"Summerfield, FL","Reviewed July 14, 2023","If it hadn't been for Crystal, I wouldn't even have considered AmeriSave. AmeriSave had nothing to do with it. It was her. She was a very smart young lady, and she went out of her way to explain everything to me. She worked really hard getting my stuff done so I can get the money. I would recommend asking for her. If somebody said, ""Why did you go with that company?"" I would say, ""It was because of her."" The process took maybe 30 days from start to finish. I've done it one time many years ago, and there's a big difference. I never had to go through all that stuff that I had to go through just to get paperwork and copies. It's just too much. The first time was better. If Crystal have not talked to me about it and explained everything, I would have never done it. As far as the rates and terms, I thought it would have been higher than what she offered me but they were what I expected.",5
A,"Snellville, GA","Reviewed July 14, 2023",AmeriSave's application process was pretty simple and straightforward. It took less than 15 minutes and everything went smoothly.,5
Gary,"Pleasant View, TN","Reviewed July 13, 2023",The reps were thorough and they communicated very well with us. It was a fairly painless deal. Everything went as I thought it would. It helped that I had good credit. The whole process from start to finish was 30 days. We have done this before with the mortgage company that we previously had and the process went back and forth. It took us four months.,5
Dicoy,"Girard, OH","Reviewed July 13, 2023","AmeriSave gave me a good option. The process was seamless. It was much simpler than getting my first house. They have an online portal where I could submit all my stuff and sign all my documents. It's very user-friendly. It gives you everything. It tells you where you got pending tasks. They send emails to you when you have stuff to do. That was the reason it was fast. After all the paperwork was in, the appraisal came out within a couple days. It took about a week to get the appraisal back. Within a couple of days, the underwriting came out. That didn't take long too.",5
Burl,"Bonne Terre, MO","Reviewed July 12, 2023","AmeriSave is a really good company They were dedicated about getting the loan closed. The reps were really easy to work with and good at what they do. I would always have an issue uploading documents through their portal and my loan officer would say, ""Don't worry. You can just text or email it to me instead of uploading.""",5
Tamara,"New Britain, CT","Reviewed July 12, 2023","I did the preapproval and I got a lot of phone calls from different companies. But I decided to give AmeriSave a try. It was something about the rep, Ryan. He sounded really sincere and honest. The process was pretty simple. He asked me some straightforward questions about my credit and my income. Then, they did all the work and put everything together. He walked me through every phase of what was going to happen, what to expect, and the paperwork. Every time something came to my email, he would send me a text to say, “Check your email.” It was a really easy process, given that it was my first time refinancing my house. Also, it was online and it was pretty easy for me and I really liked it. I didn't have to fax anything. I was able to just sit at my computer and print, scan, and upload documents.",5
Olivier,"Grand Prairie, TX","Reviewed July 12, 2023","They offered a good deal. They sent me an application. I filled it up. The rep asked everything he can ask based on all those stuff. At the end of it, he said, ""Yeah. You're approved."" It was quick. I was not expecting to get qualified for that amount because it's what I wanted and AmeriSave helped me to reach it. Other banks were just giving me little money.",5
Brian,"Danville, WV","Reviewed July 3, 2023","The rep that I worked with helped me along the process and made the experience more enjoyable than a task for me. The other ones did not. I had to do all the work and I didn't appreciate that. But with the AmeriSave, they made the experience a lot easier. They have my AmeriSave account to log into. It tells me my task that I have to do in order for them to process. That got a little aggravating 'cause it kept repeating the task over and over. But all I would have to do was call and talk to my loan originator and she straightened everything out. She didn't let me go through all that online mistakes. She was wonderful. I like her ability to know what I needed and what I was talking about. When I told her some of our situations, she already knew. She had done it with somebody else. She kept in touch all the time. I like having one person.",5
Maria,"Columbus, GA","Reviewed July 3, 2023","The application process was easy. The roughest part was just, after I thought I had submitted everything, I had to keep going to get stuff because I had some stuff in my name for other people. However, AmeriSave told me what I needed and everything went smoothly. Erin and Jennifer were the two ladies that helped me the most, and they were really good. I liked the way they communicated with the updated technology. That's really what kept me with AmeriSave. At one point, I had an offer for someone else and the rate was a little better, but it was hard to reach them. Every time I called them, I got a voicemail. Between Erin and Jennifer, one would text, and if one wasn't in, the other one would say, ""Hey, she's not in, but I can help."" That was the best part.",5
Sean,"Banks, OR","Reviewed July 2, 2023","Working with them was positive. From beginning to the end, it was really quick. The rep I worked with was straightforward. Plus, their rates beat everything else I found by a point. I got a really good rate at AmeriSave. You should check them out.",5
Michael,"Saint Joseph, MO","Reviewed July 2, 2023",Their promptness at getting back to us when they said they would stood out. We went with a home improvement deal and everything was funded in 30 days. The communication and response was good and we had a very good experience with the rep. The terms were really good too.,4
Toni,"Wethersfield, CT","Reviewed July 1, 2023","The loan officer, Ali, was very responsive, his communication was thorough, and he was very upfront. The application was fairly easy because Ali guided me through any questions that I had. The underwriting was also pretty quick and I was able to lock in at a rate of 5.7. There were some last minute things that they were requesting but that was more of the seller's fault for not sending me the addendums that we needed. So the hold-up wasn't on AmeriSave's part. Now, I own my dream home.",5
Lori,"San Tan Valley, AZ","Reviewed July 1, 2023","I had a great experience when I reached out to AmeriSave and I got quick responses. I would recommend them. They were wonderful and I was surprised at how easy it was for them. I was expecting lower rates but based on the appraisal, I understand.",5
Earl,"Rossville, GA","Reviewed June 30, 2023","Everything was good and quick. It seemed to be pretty well taken care of. The only issues that my wife had is that she keeps getting calls or mail about some kind of life insurance. She wasn't happy with that. But the whole process of refinancing went pretty well and it took about three weeks. Our loan officer was pretty good, and easy to get in contact with and to talk to. Amerisave definitely made things a lot easier and less stressful.",5
Jean,"Lake Barrington, IL","Reviewed June 30, 2023","AmeriSave's rep walked me through the whole thing. He was stupendous. I would email him. And he would call me back in five minutes. However, the loan processor was very slow and not responsive. But the rate was excellent.",5
Christine,"Sparta, MI","Reviewed June 30, 2023","Time-wise, everything was better with AmeriSave than I expected and things pretty much went without a hitch. Everyone that I dealt with was honest and forthcoming. They were really good about responding back to me with questions and informing me of the next steps and what I needed to do. So I would recommend them, based on my experience. I did a cash-out refi and the process was finished in a month.",5
Brandon,"Grove City, OH","Reviewed June 28, 2023","AmeriSave Mortgage gave me the best rate and they seem to actually want to help. I went with an FHA loan. My loan officer was really good. She gave me her personal phone number to text if I had any questions or concerns. There were several times that I texted her when she was off the clock, and she still had no issues with answering any questions that I had. The only problem that I have with the whole thing is who they hired to do my title. They don't answer the phone ever. I still haven't got my closing papers, and they're not really responsive to what's going on.",5
Brandon,"Auburn, AL","Reviewed June 21, 2023","Brian was able to be patient with me as I got all the documents. He was able to relate to me like a soldier would. So that stood out to me. It was pretty easy to navigate everything during the application process. The loan number changed after the process. It became a 10-digit number and I'm in the process of getting that number. I wish I would have had the new number already. That way, I don't have to call back and get it. But other than that, everything was cool and pretty easy. Everything was being done in the right way. I'm a veteran, so I was able to use VA loan benefits. They helped me to understand what I was doing more.",5
Clifford,"Sun City West, AZ","Reviewed June 20, 2023","My loan officer was down-to-earth, and he wasn't trying to sell me. He was trying to find out what I needed. But the application process online was a pain because Amerisave's website for uploading documents had a lot of repetitive computer generated requests. When I called them, I asked, “Do you need this?” and they said, “Oh, no. That's just computer generated. Ignore that.” So they should slow down the automated responses and have some oversight on that. In that way, a customer won't receive requests that weren't actual requests. The underwriting took about four days. It was pretty quick. ",5
Quang,"Washington, DC","Reviewed June 19, 2023","I already had a lender in mind, but my friend suggested I get a second opinion, so I talked to the AmeriSave people. My friend had taken a mortgage out from them four times, and he recommended them to me. I was interested in closing as fast as possible and skipping as many steps as possible to close on time in a 30-day mortgage time frame. My priority was speed and ease, and it seemed like AmeriSave would be the easiest to get the paperwork processed fast. Right off the bat, they said, “We can waive the appraisal” based on the software they already have. The underwriters said it would already be good. I decided to switch over to them, and everything went as smoothly as advertised. ",5
Stephanie,"Blue Springs, MO","Reviewed June 18, 2023","One night at 1 o'clock in the morning, I went online and typed something. The rep answered and I worked with him. He was great. The communication was good. I prefer to deal with the person I dealt with. Most companies switch you to too many people. I told him from the beginning, ""If that's gonna happen, it's not gonna work."" He just cut all that and said, ""Hey, just work with me."" I got good rates and terms. My situation was very unique because I have a sick mom here and I'm up all night trying to take care of her. The rep worked with me tremendously and that made a big difference. If they would just really look at a person's unique situation, it will work a lot.",5
Douglas,"Custer, SD","Reviewed June 17, 2023","Everybody was very nice and helpful, and the process was very smooth. From beginning to end, it took maybe a month. During the application process, the rep helped me through everything and answered any questions that I had. He always answered my phone calls right away and when he didn't, he would call back right away too. So, that made it nice to work with him. He was always there and I was impressed with him and his willingness to help. He was very good at explaining and laying everything out and exactly, like what we needed to find and ways to find everything. Getting the house refinanced changed quite a bit of stuff and made things a lot easier. AmeriSave handled everything and if there were any different criteria, they made it work the best for me. It was good.",5
Gary,"Ellijay, GA","Reviewed June 15, 2023","They were excellent. I had a couple of houses fall through prior to the one that I actually purchased so they had to stop loans. I was not happy with on the two properties I put an offer in so I reneged on going forward on the mortgage stuff. They were very patient with me trying to find the right house. My rep, Jeffrey was phenomenal and he explained things really well.",5
Janice,"Conyers, GA","Reviewed June 15, 2023","AmeriSave's portal was easy to use and the customer service was great. The refi process was easy. I did all my documents online. It was a breeze. It was already on my computer. So, I just attached it, and they responded quickly. The representative that I worked with was great. She responded quickly. When I got denied the first time, I went for the second time and she helped me. AmeriSave is the best company ever.",5
Joseph,"Piketon, OH","Reviewed June 15, 2023","I did everything online, then started making some calls and everybody was very helpful and informative. I didn't have any idea what to do when I started, but the reps worked me through the questions that I had. This was a simple process. Rates could always be lower, but it wasn't bad at all. Overall, it was a great experience, and I'd recommend AmeriSave.",5
Khoa,"Austin, TX","Reviewed June 8, 2023",My loan officer replied to almost every single email of mine. He called me back if he could not answer his phone right away. He was very responsible and he answered all my concerns. I am satisfied with whatever Amerisave did for me.,5
Wendy,"Decatur, GA","Reviewed June 8, 2023",They connected with me and continued to work with me through the process. The rep walked me through and made sure I understood what was expected. They assisted me when additional information was requested to make sure that I was able to meet the requirements. I refinanced with them and they made sure that everything was flowing in a expedient manner. I was very pleased with everything.,5
Delmar,"Mill Shoals, IL","Reviewed June 8, 2023","I got a remortgage and got the rate locked in with them. I had a great experience and they helped me through the process on the phone. They gave me a good rate and in good time too. With the rate, at least I can keep my house. They were very informative, helpful, kind and considerate.",5
Ashleigh,"Fruithurst, AL","Reviewed June 8, 2023","The application process with Amerisave went smoothly. Their rates were better than the local brick-and-mortar company that I had spoken with. The rep was wonderful. He answered all my questions, was very timely with response to emails or phone calls regardless of the time, and was available through the entire process. The process took a couple of months and part of that was because I was in the middle of the divorce. The title company and the underwriters needed a lot of additional documentation to say why there was a refinance since my rate was going up. They needed to justify it. Going from a 2.7 to 5.5 is not ideal. But considering the market right now, it's very fair. I was very pleased with the entire process.",5
Steven,"Midland Park, NJ","Reviewed June 8, 2023","I would recommend Amerisave. The approval process was fairly quick, and getting everything finalized was additional time. There were a couple of hoops that we had to jump through but that was more on my end.",5
Brian,"Jamestown, OH","Reviewed June 7, 2023","AmeriSave Mortgage was the first one to bend backwards to take my information and get the ball rolling. And they were the first one that responded. Bobby was our first initial guy that I spoke to, and he was the loan originator. He was able to put a request into my existing mortgage company through AmeriSave and through underwriters. He was informational and he helped a bunch. He gave me his personal number because of all the trouble we had with getting information from my existing mortgage company. And he offered, if I had trouble getting ahold of them after hours, to go ahead and shoot him a text, and he would call me back. He went out of his way to help me out. He did great. With today's rates, I got the best that I could with what was offered. If the rates come down, I would reach back out to him and just refi, no money out, no cash out refi, just for a lower rate, whenever the rates come back down.",5
Bart,"Glen Burnie, MD","Reviewed June 7, 2023","I refinanced with AmeriSave two and a half years ago, and they contacted me due to an internal audit saying that they had to rectify something. They said they did an internal audit, and that a mistake was made on my initial refinance, and asked me if I wanted to refinance again and save some money. I did that. The process was long drawn out just like every other refinance or house purchase, but AmeriSave was very helpful. It's a process. It's the nature of the beast. The new rate was fantastic. They had to give me the rate that I would have gotten two years ago. So, compared to today's rate, I made a killing. Overall, AmeriSave has been fantastic to work with. When you reach out to them, they're always quick to call back if they don't answer the phone right away and always helpful with answers.",5
Anthony,"Dallas, GA","Reviewed June 7, 2023","AmeriSave Mortgage has been great. However, it took a month and a half to get everything done. I understand paperwork, but it dragged along. And it was frustrating because we had to call AmeriSave a bunch of times to get answers. Other than that, everything set up perfectly. We're happy with our mortgage because AmeriSave took out all the credit card debt that we had, and we are comfortable with our payment and rate.",4
Coleman,"Chesapeake, VA","Reviewed June 7, 2023","I worked with AmeriSave Mortgage before. It is a very easy process. They had our employers in their system already, so it wasn't a lot of, “Give me this, give me that, send it over.” They had access to a lot of it already. And it was much smoother and easier process versus sending over my whole life story every week to a loan officer. The rep was easy to work with it. Always available, always answered the phone, clicked the emails. And he was very helpful on the forefront. Because they got the underwriters that bugged me about everything, but he was always one step ahead of the game. We did a 40-day close, but AmeriSave was ready to close within 30 days.",5
Lisa,"Carrollton, GA","Reviewed June 7, 2023","The application process initially was fine but I was annoyed at the very end. I was working with someone who was very good. Sean responded daily and I had a portal where I could upload stuff and she would do it for me. But now, our mortgage is with somebody else. As soon as it was over, I got a letter telling me that it's not with AmeriSave.",3
Mike,"Delray Beach, FL","Reviewed June 7, 2023","AmeriSave would be one to look at because we had a good experience with them. We were able to lock in with them at a low rate. And they were the lowest price that we could find at the time. It was a 15-year, standard loan that we got. The process was a bit more than I am used to. Because on my last few mortgages, we went into an office and filled out paperwork. And they asked all the questions at the time. Sometimes they would come back and ask a few more questions. But with AmeriSave, it was all electronic. And we got notices every day on things that needed to be done as I went through the process of uncovering. Which was more than I remember doing. And the closing was different. Because before, we were at an attorney's office. This time, it was at the title company office. There was an attorney involved in it. But the attorney wasn't there for the closing. But everything still went smooth. From the time that we found the condo, it was 45 days to close.",5
David,"Bozeman, MT","Reviewed June 7, 2023","The mortgage process was simple. All the paperwork was done online. But uploading the documents was a little confusing. When they would send me some of the different types of documents. like the loan estimate versus the closing docs, every time we would make a change to it, they would send another one. And I didn't know that each one of those had to be signed. But eventually, we got that all squared away and they sent them all back to me. Once we got to closing, they sent somebody out to the house to sign all the papers. Everything was funded and the whole process was quick. My rep was very friendly and knowledgeable in what he was doing. He kept me well informed. When he wasn't available, he had another representative reach out to me via email. They could improve on the timeliness of getting back to me though. I had a question on one thing and it took the entire day. Other than that, working with them definitely assisted me in my financial needs.",5
S,"Bradenton, FL","Reviewed June 7, 2023",The process with AmeriSave was long and very tedious with providing the documents required for a mortgage. But it went very smoothly. They were good about helping me understand what they were looking for. It was a really good process.,4
Thomas,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed June 7, 2023","Our experience with Amerisave was great. Our loan officer, Trevor, and our loan processor, Leslie were very helpful throughout our loan process. From prequalification to closing, Amerisave made everything easy for us to complete. Trevor and Leslie are the BEST!",5
Emily,"Crossville, TN","Reviewed June 7, 2023","The Amerisave rep I worked with was wonderful. Any time I had a question, I called him and he answered and he was there every step of the way.

I would highly recommend AmeriSave.",5

He was very helpful and mindful of our schedule and our deadline. He worked with us and worked on weekends and during vacations to make sure our needs were met. However, the underwriters were not helpful and they would not commit to dates. But Conner would call that person and talk to them and, lo and behold, the next day, everything was done.",4
Hugh,"Houston, TX","Reviewed June 7, 2023","I inherited my dad's home and to keep the property, I had to get with AmeriSave. They walked me through this whole process and they handled everything for me. I flunked a few refis and when I got with these guys, they made every effort to make sure that all the information was sent timely to the underwriters. They got my loan through and at a decent interest rate. They had two people working with the team and their manager worked with me, too. When I couldn't reach my two primary reps, I called my manager and he got right on the phone. They would call me back with an answer to a question and that was amazing because it had been handled.

Kathy,"Janesville, WI","Reviewed June 6, 2023","Had a great experience with Amerisave in particular Lynn ** and Megan **. Really felt they did a wonderful job with a difficult refinance. Had been waiting 5 years to finally get this done. They listened. Were straightforward in all aspects thru the process. Explained everything well. I truly appreciated their professionalism and yet still felt like I was treated as a human being with a name, not just being pushed thru a process.",5
Judy,"Sullivan, MO","Reviewed June 6, 2023","AmeriSave called me. At that point, I was so distraught that I wasn't gonna get the extra 10,000 I needed to get this home I wanted. The girl said, “Let us just try and see what we can do.” I asked, “Is it gonna take my credit score down?” I was told. “No, but we'll know.” I filled out the application with her on the line then I went to the store. She called me back 15 minutes later and said I was approved for that amount. It had been a whirlwind since then that I couldn't even believe how it all happened. I got home, DocuSigned everything, and did everything I needed to do. ",5
Carlos,"Athens, GA","Reviewed June 5, 2023","Daniel, my mortgage agent, made the process of applying for a home mortgage easy and quick.

Seth,"Greeley, CO","Reviewed June 1, 2023","There were a few questions that AmeriSave asked on the website and we put that in. Then we got a phone call and we talked about a few different options from the representative. I was impressed with the rep’s willingness to spend a little bit of extra time to walk us through the whole application online. Miguel, the rep, was quick to answer questions. It was nice to be able to text back and forth, so we didn't have to wait for both of us to be free for phone calls. So that was good. There were a couple of questions about my wife's employment and the pay stubs weren't in the right format. So, we had a couple of phone calls on that but AmeriSave was able to sort it out and accept the letter from the employer in lieu of the pay stubs in the format that they wanted. The application and underwriting process took maybe two weeks and it was smooth.",5
Brenda,"Jessieville, AR","Reviewed May 31, 2023","I sold my house and moved in to this house. I bought it out right with the money I made off of my first house so I had a little left over. That’s what I was gonna use to fix the house up but prices has gone up. My first company didn't charge that much. It only cost me about $500 to get a loan from them. But with AmeriSave, it was expensive and I was surprised that it cost that much. The application was easy, though. They walked me through it and the rep I worked with was wonderful. He was very prompt and if I called and asked a question, he was on top of it. When he went on vacation, he left another gentleman in charge. They knew what they were doing and I enjoyed talking to them. I could have gotten a better interest than what they gave me but the people there were very nice.",5
Judson,"Baxley, GA","Reviewed May 31, 2023","The broker from AmeriSave that I was talking to, Timothy, gave me the best deal. He guaranteed that he could beat any rate that a competitor wanted to try to get you with and he was right. Any time that a competitor gave me something lower, he was able to beat it. He was in contact with me through email and once we exchanged cellphone numbers, he was texting me throughout the day, making sure that he was doing the right stuff and getting the rates that I needed. He was very adamant on wanting to get my business and he was very easy to get in touch with. He could answer anything that I had a question about and I couldn't have asked for any better service from him.",5
Tonya,"Suffolk, VA","Reviewed May 31, 2023","Debra worked with me a lot. I ended up getting sick, so she really worked with me through the whole process from start to finish. I was very pleased with that. It probably took me about almost two months because I had went on vacation, and then I fell sick. So, trying to get all the paperwork that I needed was a little time-consuming because I was admitted in the hospital. AmeriSave beared with me and got it done. Debra sent me emails and she did get in contact with me by phone. She'll send me an email, and then I get back in touch with her. So, that was really helpful.",5
Zawaria,"Spring, TX","Reviewed May 31, 2023","I liked the rate that AmeriSave had. I submitted information online. I got a call within a couple of days and I started the refinancing process. The only thing is I didn't like the time period that the underwriting process took and it cost me more at the end. I was charged some fees, which were tacked on to the end of the loan. Being a single woman and recently divorced, I don't like that at all. At that moment, I had no choice because I had to get the refinance done based on my divorce decree. I had a deadline to complete. So, I couldn't just step out because of the extra fees that were added. It was two days before closing and I couldn't just back out. I didn't have the option. So, I was pretty upset about that. ",3

We were really trying to find someone who was willing to work with us and give us the best possible deal. My wife used the web and found Amerisave. We gave them a shot and did a cash-out refinance. It was easy even though there was a lot of crap we had to do, and from the moment the lady, Joanna, reached out to me, they were excited to help.

I wasn't aware that I was going to have to upload all of these things until I got ahold of Richard. I let him know how I wanted to go about it and he said, “I'm gonna hook you up with the loan processor.” But even though he had to branch me out to the loan processor, he still was my main point of contact.",5

The underwriters are extremely thorough and I had to find some really obscure information. From beginning to close, the process took over a month. It was a painful month and it's nobody's fault. They have to have documents and that's just the way it is. Overall, AmeriSave did everything they had to do.",5

The whole process was a lot quicker than the other banks I was working with. The only thing was I was looking at a duplex to live in also and it’ll be my second home there. But AmeriSave is requiring a 20% down for a program like that, while a lot of other banks only require less than a 10% down.",5

Samantha,"Four Oaks, NC","Reviewed May 7, 2023",We were in the process of selling our home and then purchasing a new home. We were not satisfied with the current mortgage company we were working with so I did a Google search and picked AmeriSave. The process was very simple for the most part. We had all of our documentation accessible because we had already been going through the process with another company. Everything was pretty seamless. We sent everything in one afternoon and we were semi-approved. We got the final approval the next day and we kept getting all of our stuff sent in. We closed in two weeks. We wanted it to go fast so we pushed everything to go as quickly as possible.,5

If I had any questions, I could call him. They called me a couple of times too to make sure that I understood everything and if I had any questions. The whole process was quick. The rate was high but it was not AmeriSave's fault. Abraham got me the lowest that he could, considering what the government had said. The terms were fine and it was what we agreed on. I would recommend AmeriSave and use them again.",5

All the team members, even the processor for the mortgage, was also very good. They completed their tasks within 15 days. It was quick. The interest rate is so-so and they have the policy where you can buy the point and it could come down. They told me the amount that was required for this point but they did not charge that same amount. They told me that I might need to pay $1,600 but they charged 2,200 for the same amount of days. So that was a discrepancy. The final amount was not accurate and I mentioned these things to the officer. She tried to contact me but after that, she never got back to me. ",5

Hanna,"Brandon, FL","Reviewed May 6, 2023","William, the first rep, was awesome. He talked with me all the time and if I had any questions, it was great. He was AmeriSave’s intake guy. Then, once I got passed off to a loan officer, he was okay. It took a little bit longer to get my stuff than it did before. But overall, it was a positive experience compared to some people that I've talked to. The rate was the best one out of all, so I took it. People should check the rates before they decide but for me, it was a lot about how responsive the system was and what hours they worked.",5

The automatic send-out of to-do things didn't seem to make sense though. The underwriters are probably the people initiating that. You would get 2 things done and 10 would come at you. But when we got under contract, it came close to closing within a month. The rates were fine and we locked in early enough to where it was advantageous to us. People should check out AmeriSave. We already have.",5

I have experience from other apps, and those were definitely a better experience from that perspective. I tried to use Rocket Mortgage a couple of times and they had a better app, but when I finally had an offer that was accepted on a place that was moving forward, AmeriSave had better rates at the moment. I did it at a bad time though, so I wish the rate and terms were better. All in all, AmeriSave is worth using if you maintain good rates comparative to the market.",5

It was an excellent process. There was one point where there was confusion with another guy that I was working with. I work two jobs, and they had the wrong employer as my primary place of work. It got confused somehow. Once I contacted John, it got taken care of and it got updated correctly. He kept in constant communication with me.

The rep we worked with was very knowledgeable and helpful. She guided us and tried to help us keep that rate during this long process because after a certain amount of days, the locked-in rate goes away. She was able to extend it. It was a good process and we're happy with our all-in closing costs. We got a very fair price. It was just a tedious process. I wish there weren't so many technical things.",4

They wanted more details on some of the documents. I thought all they needed was just my divorce was final and the date. But they required more than that.

Jake,"Wellford, SC","Reviewed April 27, 2023","The current market isn't the best right now, but AmeriSave gave me the lowest interest rate that I could find from the companies and banks that I looked into and we were able to lock it in. The loan process was really simple. The reps helped me out a lot and made things really clear. AmeriSave had an online portal where I just had documents that I needed to submit. They talked to me on the phone whenever I needed to and called me with updates at least once a week. All the communication was really good. I just had to find and fulfill documents as needed. Right at the end of the process, there were some documents that I needed last minute, and they worked very hard on the last day or two of my application process to make sure that I could close in time. It was really timely at the end. All in all, AmeriSave did a really good job, and it definitely helped the house closing process.",5

Being in a high interest rate environment, AmeriSave's interest rate and terms were decent. We got 5.8%. I had to pay some points, but I got a little cheaper rate. My attorney said he usually doesn't see many mortgage companies charging points, but he thought that was probably because they gave me a little lower rate. It was a bit unusual, but as long as we stay in the house at least five years, it will all wash out.",5
Christopher,"Painesville, OH","Reviewed April 27, 2023","Amerisave did a refi several years ago for me on one of my houses, and I have purchased two through them now. On one of the deals, I had someone that wasn't as invested, and I had to escalate on them, but as a company, Amerisave took care of me. The last representative for my latest purchase, Carlos, was fantastic. He felt like a friend more than a salesperson. After further down the process, when they assigned a team, I put my down payment, and there was a lady who was in contact with me to make sure things were moving along on the paperwork side. She was more of an administrative person versus Carlos who was more of a salesperson.",5
James,"Williamston, SC","Reviewed April 25, 2023","AmeriSave worked with me better. I reached out to them and they set me up with a loan processor. His name was Darek and he was straight up with me. He said everything that I would need and I would get that. If underwriting ever said something, he would immediately let me know. It was an easy process for him. He was more than perfect.",4
Dennis,"Alamogordo, NM","Reviewed April 24, 2023","I refinanced with AmeriSave and my rep explained everything and repeated it two or three times, if necessary. He stayed in touch. Every time I had a question, I emailed and he was right up front. He told me from day one that if I wanted to get ahold of him, I was to email him and not call because he's always in meetings and talking with people. Every time he stops and breaks from one before he goes to the next one, he checks his email but doesn't check messages on the phone. It was never more than an hour or two before he would call back.",5
Daniel,"Midlothian, VA","Reviewed April 23, 2023","My fiancee and I were first-time homebuyers and we were looking for a mortgage to buy a place. A few people I know recommended AmeriSave. My parents used them to refinance and my brother and his wife looked into them as well. The loan originator I was working with left AmeriSave and did not let me know. I lost contact with him. Luckily, I called AmeriSave and got in touch with another originator, Justin, who was fantastic. He did a great job. He felt very genuine and honest. He answered a lot of the questions I had about the house-buying process, mortgages, and weighing my options, one way versus the other. I appreciated that.",4
Kristine,"Knightdale, NC","Reviewed April 22, 2023","Amerisave was very responsive. They kept me informed in the entire process. They were good to work with. The approval was very fast. The process was online primarily, but if I called with questions, they always picked up the phone or called me back. I've had six houses and this is probably the easiest one I've ever gone through. The mortgage rates are not where we want them to be but they were able to work with us to buy down the rate. I would recommend them.",5
Faisal,"San Jose, CA","Reviewed April 21, 2023","AmeriSave Mortgage gave me a better rate. The application was very good and straightforward. The customer service representatives were very professional. The rate and terms are pretty competitive. When I was going through the process, a lot of companies approached me and they wanted to give me the mortgage or take me as a customer. So, I provided them with the details. They tried to match the rate and the service and whatever offer they had to make. More educated people than I am in terms of mortgage pretty much said that the mortgage offer that I had with AmeriSave was pretty good. No one actually came up with something which could challenge AmeriSave.",5
Lindsie,"Farmington, NM","Reviewed April 19, 2023","AmeriSave was phenomenal. I like that you go at your own pace and if you want to close fast, you get the online things done as quickly as you can. And if you take your time, then that reflects. Their loan process was very simple. I worked with Austin and I was impressed with his thoroughness and quickness. He knew pretty much the answer to every question and if he didn't, he got back to me as soon as possible to get that answered. The rates I got are decent for what they are at right now. You always want better. But we got quotes from other lenders and AmeriSave was right in the ballpark where everyone else was.",5
Dennis,"Mount Juliet, TN","Reviewed April 19, 2023","AmeriSave was really easy to use and both of the people we dealt with were really efficient.

Phil,"Johns Island, SC","Reviewed April 19, 2023","AmeriSave was easy to work with and applying was painless. They set me up online on their portal and everything was done then. If I was lacking any information, they would contact me again. They didn't hound me and left it up to me to progress through the process. They encouraged me where I needed them. It was a divorce and I refinanced to have the money to buy my ex's half out. So, there was a time frame of three months waiting for a separation agreement to be reached through the attorneys before we could proceed. But they kept offering me rate lock extensions to keep the rate that I received in December all the way through March. I highly recommend AmeriSave. It was everything that I needed.",5
Gregory,"Rochester, MA","Reviewed April 12, 2023",It took me about six weeks to complete my refi application with AmeriSave. It was easy and the communication was excellent. They answered me every time I asked them a question and I'm happy with the rate and terms that I got.,5

The application process went well. They were pretty quick about trying to get it done.",5
Michelle,"Normal, IL","Reviewed April 11, 2023",I liked the customer service I received from the AmeriSave mortgage originator.

Julie,"Lancaster, KY","Reviewed April 11, 2023","We were looking to get out of the reverse mortgage that we had. So, we were looking to refinance what we had, and AmeriSave seemed to offer what I was looking for. We worked with Mark. He was wonderful. He answered all our questions. He seemed to go out of his way to make things easier. As far as the application process, it was strange because I've never done one online before. That was a little different. The reverse mortgage wasn't online. I've never filled out anything that detailed and intricate online. Mark walked me through what I was supposed to do and what I was seeing, and how to traverse it. I was lucky. I'm not really good at uploading. I could have got my daughter. What made it easy was, he just let me take pictures of documents, and then send them to him, and he'd upload them. He was very patient. He stayed in contact. It made a difference. We're older and we have a lot going on.",5
Malcolm,"Cypress, TX","Reviewed April 11, 2023","The AmeriSave guy that I was speaking to on the phone made it short, sweet, and easy. The man's been following up with me. I deal with mortgage companies all the time. This guy was on top of his business. As far as the online application process, it was pretty straightforward. It's the person that's behind the phone and the way that they communicate with the client that makes the difference.",5
Dale,"Windsor, VA","Reviewed April 11, 2023","The rep I worked with was very patient, especially with my limited skills when it comes to technology. Also, it was easy to get in contact with them. When I call, they would either call me back or tell me to email them.  The rate was a lot cheaper than what we were doing at first, so I can't complain about that. And I guess I should have done it sooner, then the rates probably would have been lower.",5
Chimeria,"Pittsburgh, PA","Reviewed April 11, 2023","AmeriSave was cheaper than other places that I had looked at. Their rates were better. Also, their reps were nice and polite.",5
Dale,"Orlando, FL","Reviewed April 11, 2023",I had looked at refinancing in the past and there were some complications so I had some reluctance at first. I wasn't sure if I was going to go through with it. I talked to Mark from AmeriSave and I told him I have a lot of concerns. He was very reassuring and he said there were other situations that he had experienced with other clients and that I gotta trust that they could get the job done.,5
Lee,"Volcano, HI","Reviewed April 11, 2023","AmeriSave rose to the top of several different websites that were independent of the mortgage companies themselves. That's why I chose them for a new mortgage. We purchased a second home. I gave a call to the number and I spoke to a man named Abrim. He answered all of my questions and walked me through what the process would be. He was the most helpful in everything. That was why I knew from the beginning why AmeriSave was so highly rated. Abrim started all the paperwork. He also had me work with another gentleman who was his brother that worked in Chicago. They helped me get everything set up. On the whole, it was the customer service that was on the phone for me. All the time I talked to the two gentlemen, they were super nice and very positive and got the job done right away.",5
Craig,"Charles Town, WV","Reviewed April 11, 2023","The experience that I’ve had with AmeriSave has been pleasant and everything has gone well. The application process for the refi went as smoothly and expected as possible. But for the HELOC, there were some hiccups. On the first one, there were some errors based on AmeriSave, for my loan originator, that was missed. So, we had to almost try to do another one or a substitute in its place, which turned out to be a little bit more time-consuming on both ends than we had anticipated. It took a month longer. But the communication with the officer was good. We stayed in touch on a weekly basis. It was more along the lines of their end of getting all the i's dotted, t’s crossed and the process approved. The rate was one of the reasons behind doing two. ",4
Heidi,"Odessa, FL","Reviewed April 11, 2023","I had a very good experience with AmeriSave the first time. But this time, their departments weren’t talking to each other so much and I had to fix some stuff that I probably shouldn't have had to fix. So, it was a little frustrating. They had my closing disclosure wrong so when we signed docs, it was still wrong. We did a 1031 and we had an amount and that was wrong. It showed that we owed $200,000, and we only had to pay $200. That was how far off it was. I had been telling them a week before and nobody would fix it. So, I wasn't happy with that. But everybody was good. ",5
Eric,"Mount Storm, WV","Reviewed April 11, 2023","We did a cash-out mortgage and the process was pretty straightforward. The rate and terms are exactly where I wanted to be, completely affordable and we were able to do a lock in an extremely good rate for 30 years.",5

I enjoyed working with AmeriSave. They made things easy and pain-free.",5

Verna,"Flowood, MS","Reviewed April 11, 2023","My loan officer was great, informative and knowledgeable. However, it was a lengthy process, way longer than I wanted it to be. There were a lot of back and forth of things that they were asking for that I didn't think were necessary, especially with it being a refi. It was almost as if I had never had a mortgage loan before. Some of the things they were asking for were ridiculous. It was such a hassle. If I had to do it again, I definitely would not.",2
Hollie,"Florence, AL","Reviewed April 11, 2023","When I made the first phone call to AmeriSave, it was late in the evening and I liked the rep that I talked to. His skills and what he was doing was the reason that I went with AmeriSave because he was determined to keep me on the line and for me to not check around. The online application was extremely easy and the only problem that I had was when I was trying to download some of the items that were required to be downloaded, it wasn't showing that I had downloaded them, which caused little glitches. But other than that, I used my AmeriSave app where it told me what my status was and what I needed to submit, and I really appreciated it because they said exactly what they needed.",5
Kevin,"Austin, TX","Reviewed April 11, 2023","I called them and got a call back immediately. I really liked the guy who I was talking to, Timothy. He was very helpful and patient. I told him that the mortgage was not a huge deal for me so I'm gonna take time and shop. He didn't bother me until I made one call back. Then he ran through an infinite number of scenarios with me. When he found out what my real goal was, he found the perfect product for me right off the bat. I was impressed with that. I like the service and I like the process enough just to go with them. I never had to leave my couch. That alone and the closing, in terms of what your time is worth, makes AmeriSave a strong product.",5

It couldn't have been a lot easier. Jonathan signed everything. He even gave me his cell phone number and answered my calls when I had questions. The monthly payment worked for us. I would highly recommend AmeriSave to anybody.",5
Kira,"Watford City, ND","Reviewed April 11, 2023","I would recommend Amerisave to future prospective home buyers. They were informative and not pushy. Everybody had different things and perks about trying to get us to choose them but AmeriSave did not. They didn't try to incentivize anything to make me choose them over anyone else.

Marla,"Mcallen, TX","Reviewed April 11, 2023","The person who took my call the first time and throughout the process kept me in the loop.

K.,"Or, OR","Reviewed March 31, 2023","Overall, I ended up very pleased with AmeriSave. We started out with a loan officer named Jenna, who was incredibly patient with me. Especially I didn't know even how to download things. We had a lot to download with lots of information. She was so patient and taught me how to download. That was really great. But I noticed after a couple of several interactions with Jenna, they sent me to somebody else who then started requesting more information. Then I started getting all of these other emails which were from all different people. I felt like I was interacting with a lot of people over the internet. Sometimes I would send the information to Jenna, and then the next person would call me and ask me for it. I'm 70 and I'm not that computer-literate.

Angel,"Wimauma, FL","Reviewed March 30, 2023",I was in the process of wanting to refinance. I typed in the top companies that refinance in 2023 and AmeriSave was one of the top ones. I went with them mainly because of the loan officer. They were very customer service-oriented and they were looking out for my best interest. That's what I liked most about them. They didn't make me feel obligated or they didn't make me feel like it was just the interest of the company. They made me feel like the whole process was about me and how they could help me. That's what really drew my attention to them.,5

I also didn't like that I had to pay a lot to pay it down. My costs were $20,000. Other than that, their website was really user-friendly. I could upload and they had a little task list that shows if something is pending or is complete. That was really great. They had a quick turnaround and it was easy to close.",5
Kevin,"Sidney, OH","Reviewed March 22, 2023","I decided to give AmeriSave a try after reading so many positive reviews. It's one of the worst decisions I've ever made in my life.

Next, he stated that if I provided all the requested documents within 48 hours that the loan would close in 10-14 business days (2nd broken promise). Then he stated I wouldn't have to pay any points and that they would waive the appraisal fee since I had already paid for an appraisal (3rd broken promise).

However, it was explained in detail when I questioned it. They explained about the day that this went in to process was the rate of the day.

It's just when they're trying to follow up with things that you haven't uploaded to your account, there were a couple of things that I had to wait to get, but then you'd get calls and mails about all these things that are gonna happen if you don't give the information.

Charles,"Compton, CA","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2023","AmeriSave was my primary lender. I did a refinance with them too, and as far as the process, I'm a veteran, so I went through the VA website and just put in that I was looking for a refinance. AmeriSave called me and said, ""You want a refinance?"" They beat Rocket's rate, which was the best rate that I got. AmeriSave's online application process was pretty good because you could submit all your documents online. It was easy. If you couldn't get anything to get submitted online, you can just email your primary person, and then they will put it in the online portal for you.",5

D,"Goochland, VA","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2023","Everything was going along okay and then two weeks before closing, their underwriters decided that because I wasn't moving in within 60 days, I could not do a VA loan. I had to switch to a conventional loan. I had a week to come up with 10% down. By that point, I had already said bye to the other two mortgage companies that were asking for my business. So I told Amerisave that it felt like bait and switch to me. The sales rep was great. He communicated whenever he had information. But the underwriters controlled everything and they communicated when they felt like it.",1

The whole thing was problem-free. AmeriSave wasn't hiding anything and didn't throw weird stuff in at the last minute like the last time I've done this. I couldn't be happier with the service I received. I have a neighbor that I've already told. When it comes to finances, you don't wanna steer anybody in a direction.

Phillip,"Antelope, CA","Reviewed Feb. 19, 2023","Obtaining the mortgage with AmeriSave was good and fast but there's a lot of paperwork you gotta send in and check. The rep who worked with me was very patient. I could upload the documents myself but he did that for me, so that was great. When you go through a bank, the application process is a little bit more tedious. AmeriSave is a direct lender so it goes a little faster. The rates that I received was where the market was at. AmeriSave had the better interest rate at the time, which was why I went with them. But I’d like the loan officer to reach out to me if there are better insurance rates, which would be in the best interest of me. They usually do it after six months to a year. People should do business with AmeriSave. I had great experiences.",5

I have called them a couple of times and still, I have no statement. My mortgage is due March 1st.",1

I did it months in advance because of a wait on the house to be finished building, but the whole process didn't have to take a week or so to get through underwriting. It was a pretty good experience though a little more communication could have gone well. I was comfortable with AmeriSave and the rate and term they gave me were better than anybody else.

He walked me through the application, too because sometimes the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing and they kept sending a lot of emails. He was good. The terms of the mortgage were also great. They put me in a program that went from 5.8 to 4.8. They helped me drop a whole point and Eric told me that if any programs come up, they'd be back in touch with me.",5

Then, it was a matter of the underwriters taking over. The appraisal was done and it was a painless process. The rate was also as good as I was expecting to get at the time. The process bogged down a little bit at the underwriter stage. There was a point that stretched on a little bit. But outside of that, the process went well.",4
Christina,"Leeds, AL","Reviewed Feb. 18, 2023","Obtaining the mortgage with AmeriSave was nerve-wracking not knowing if this is legit. But the reps were able to help me, walk me through what information they need and to follow up with them on their website and read over that, do some history, to make sure that I was choosing the right place. The application process online was good and easy. I like that I was able to upload the documents and do a lot of things visually, instead of having to take the time out and going to fax it. The documents you're trying to upload always pops up an error though. But if you go back into it, it shows that it was downloaded. So it was a lot of miscommunication for the website itself. But if I called and wasn't answered, the admin or the supervisor that was above the person that was helping me called me back to follow up with me instead of waiting for somebody to call back. ",5
Jeri,"Ringgold, GA","Reviewed Feb. 3, 2023","AmeriSave was quicker to respond to me and they were also more responsive overall. The application process was initially pretty easy. I did have issues with the loan processing part of the mortgage process because my loan processor changed about four different times. I had a very short close.

I had to resubmit things over and over, and every time I got a new loan processor, somebody needed a new document that somebody else had already told me was good enough. ",4

The reason for the loan was replacing a deck and building a garage, and I had already removed the deck, so the appraisal put a note in there about it being an unsafe situation. That delayed me about three weeks. The manager of my loan officer made the suggestion that if I would block the door off, securing it with plywood across the front so that it couldn’t be opened, that that may suffice.

There was a couple of bumps in the road just with my last name but he was very responsive even during the weekends. The only thing is the rate sucks.

That was what I really liked about him. He explained everything. Once I made the sixth payment, we closed in 10 days. He tried to hold the interest rate because the interest rate has a lock on it.

And they were auditing things afterwards, and it was almost a month later, I got a check because they made a mistake. A lot of the funkiness had to do with repeated requests for something that didn't exist. And I had to come up with as many pieces as I could, but I couldn't close that final gap because it never existed. They eventually through this analysis said, ""All the rest of it is solid.

I thought it was locked in at 4.875 and the whole time, I thought that was what it was going to be. But I had to pay 12 grand to get that. So, I didn't understand that upfront and I went through the whole process.

Gary,"Twentynine Palms, CA","Reviewed Dec. 14, 2022","Everybody is very polite. It worked out great. So, I just stuck with it. I just refinanced with AmeriSave Mortgage again. But the first time, it took a while, because there were some underlying situations. It was very tough getting ahold of the loan. I would leave messages, I would never get a call back. I had a very old man trying to do paperwork. The second time, the application was perfect. Less than a month. It was easier for me to just deal with the loan originator. She was on top of everything. Even this time, she was outstanding. Very polite and to the point. She would follow up just to make sure that stuff was done. Even after it was out of her hand, she still followed up with me to make sure it was all going smoothly. It took a month from start to finish. They funded it quickly. The rep did a good job in all the paperwork. It was quick and to the point.",5
Rodney,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed Dec. 13, 2022","The application process was easy. It took a few months. I had to get some paperwork and stuff like that done as far as some things that we were wanting to deed to the property. But once I got that taken care of, everything went smooth. The reps were really friendly and thorough. They really looked over the numbers but the other companies didn't do that. If there wasn't some type of loan or mortgage they wanted to give, they wanted to do it their way. These guys were pretty good. They were really optimistic and so interested in helping. Amerisave is a good company. Everything that they said, they backed it up.",5

Danielle,"Ontario, CA","Reviewed Dec. 12, 2022","AmeriSave needed paperwork in the beginning, which was fine. We had a couple of weeks off where I didn't hear anything, which was fine. But waited until the last day we had, which was like a Friday, and we were supposed to call on the Monday to meet everything, which pushed closing back a week. So, that was very stressful when they could have just told me in the beginning that they needed a, b and c, and not waited until they had all the information and say, ""Oh, nope” and kicked it back. I had a timeline to be out of the place we were at. But my loan officer worked. She was quick about trying to get everything done. The rep was good and super helpful in getting what we need. She was approachable and personable. So, I felt I could ask her anything. I talked to her about anything in the process and answered patiently and calmly.",4

I did not feel any pressure. It was really great to work with people like that. They were the greatest team.",5

I talked with her several times and I asked her to hold off on it for a certain amount of time and I had things I had to get done. Kayla came in and said, “We're taking them on the company,” looked at them if they said too long. And I told her, “The timeframe was my doing and not the previous girls.” But she said, “It's all right. I can take over from here.” She was insistent on getting the sale herself.",5
Michael,"Mountain Home, AR","Reviewed Dec. 10, 2022","AmeriSave did ask me a lot of redundant questions because I'm self-employed. They didn't really like the way I did my paperwork.

Everything to me, especially when I talked to my attorney and we went over everything, was pretty good. They asked for the documentation and I sent it over to them. It was a pretty smooth process.",5
Loneshia,"Belle Glade, FL","Reviewed Dec. 8, 2022",We did a refi with AmeriSave. It took about two and a half months. It wasn't bad. It went well.

Emerson,"Boelus, NE","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2022","My situation was a little bit complex because we did have some funds that were gifts that were a result of a vehicle that we sold. So, it was a little bit harder to get that verified. We had to get documents from the auction. But aside from that, all the other documents were pretty easy to get. Amerisave assigned me a loan officer to help me spell out anything I needed if I had written something out wrong or if I gave them the wrong information. They helped direct me to what I needed. Omar was pretty nice. He was helpful and understanding. He was a really good loan officer to work with. The rates and terms were competitive at the time that I bought a house. They were not the best of all time, but for the climate that we were in, it was a good rate.",5
Gloria,"Wilmington, DE","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2022",AmeriSave's application process was long as hell but it was okay. Their representatives were very nice. I enjoyed being with them. They were on point with everything. I will recommend AmeriSave to others because I liked the person I worked with.,5
Venisha,"Merrillville, IN","Reviewed Dec. 6, 2022","I liked everything that AmeriSave was doing and trying to help me. Marcella and her partner were really good. Marcella was very professional. She was very helpful and always ready to answer my questions. When I first started, she gave me a preapproval letter really, really fast. But then I thought I was gonna go with somebody else. So I tried to go with somebody else but they put me through a wringer. When I reached back out to Marcella, she was able and willing to help do everything that needed to get done, along with Sylvia. So they both worked very good compared to the other company that I was trying to work with. I linked everything to the portal, and it uploaded the documents with no problem. The rate was a little higher. But in the position that I was in, I was ready to do whatever. So it's still lower than what I was paying before. I was very satisfied.",5
Donovan,"Hendersonville, TN","Reviewed Dec. 6, 2022","AmeriSave's communication was excellent. If they needed anything, they would let me know. So, there was not really a whole lot of delay in the whole process. The most shocking thing about it all was the closing cost and all of the tiny fees that went in to build that closing cost.",4
Richelle,"Upper Marlboro, MD","Reviewed Dec. 5, 2022","The application process was okay. The people who handle the paperwork were busy. Their process is automated and I'd send in information, then they wouldn't receive it, and then they'd ask for more info. I sent them something, and they'd ask for something different. It was a little challenging for me, but I did do it. But the person I was dealing with helped me and said, ""Well, just send it to my text and I'll send it over."" So, it worked out. He listened to me and he was there every step of the way.",5
Shamira,"Loganville, GA","Reviewed Dec. 5, 2022","I got rates from three different companies and AmeriSave ended up having the best interest rate and the lowest down payment, so I went with them. The application was fine. The only thing that I wish was better was the documents that were needed. Two days later, they would say they needed documents for something that I already explained. It was very repetitious when it came to the documents that I had to provide. But the process itself of getting online and accessing it on the app was easy. ",4
T.,"Va, VA","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2022","AmeriSave had the best deal. I talked to the loan officer and he walked me through fees and approximate cost, and preliminary documentation. I e-signed it, and then I provided them electronically, under a secure, locked site, my information. We went back and forth a couple of times, because I was getting some additional information from them. Then I was approved. They wanted me to close sooner than I did. The rate was fantastic, but the fees ended up being a little bit higher than I expected from the beginning. But the loan officer was fantastic.",5
Gerri,"Durham, NC","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2022","I had a positive experience with AmeriSave from start to finish. The timing was good when it came to the application process. There were some documents that I had to submit and we kept in contact. It took about a little over 30 days, which is fine. My rep was excellent.

I ended up refinancing my current home with her. I worked with her and AmeriSave on the refinance. I then made a new purchase for the house that I'm moving in right now because of how it went last year on the refinance. It was a lake house that my husband and I were wanting. When it came up again, the first thing I did was call Aileen and tell her. She told me the steps to apply for a loan again. ",5

Kyle,"Gretna, NE","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2022",I looked at many companies and AmeriSave seemed to have the best overall rates. The process of applying to refinance and closing it all out took a few months. Customer service was very good.

Carrie,"Miles City, MT","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2022","The biggest problem that we had with the application process with AmeriSave was uploading my husband's driver's license when we were doing the notary and that's because he works outside and it was so scratched. But the notary was helpful and she made it happen. The rep who processed the loan was confident with his company and the loan. He calmed me with any concerns and told me that I don’t have to worry about it. I felt so comfortable and we had a personal connection. He had a personal issue with his dog and I'm a huge dog lover, and he sent me a picture of his dog after she got better with the vet. I liked him.",5

He would call just to tell me what was going on with the process so I wouldn't have to guess or wonder what was going on. The application process was all online and it was easy which was why I thought maybe I could pay my mortgage online. I got the AmeriSave app but I can't pay for my loan on the app. I have to call and they charge me $10 to make the payment. It's some ridiculous fee. But the person that came out when I closed was very professional. I couldn't ask for a better experience. Everybody was nice. The lady would call me too to check up on me. She called and told me that she was going out of town and that somebody else was going to be calling to check on me. And true enough, they did. Everybody was true to their word.

I still would make it lower, but I took what I could get in this market. The experience with AmeriSave was very pleasant. They are very good at what they do.",5
Joshua,"Sparta, TN","Reviewed Nov. 26, 2022","The application process with AmeriSave was great. I can't blame anybody because of the situation with how we were buying the house and what was needed for FHA and it was some stuff on our end that made it a major headache. But if it had not been for Michelle, the lady that had done the loan processing, I was just gonna give up and not do it at all. She's the sole reason that I went ahead and done the loan through AmeriSave. It was super easy on everything. I needed to update, scan and send back a bunch of forms. But it wasn't their fault. It was FHA needing certain documents a certain way and it was a lot of back and forth.",5
John,"Greensboro, NC","Reviewed Nov. 25, 2022","I went with an FHA and the application process was simple.

There were things that got input wrong in the beginning. As soon as I said, ""that's not right,"" he worked overtime to make sure everything was right. At one point, it got declined because they put my husband's income wrong. He figured out what they had done wrong and he was the one emailing and calling and I always knew he was on my side. He really did go above and beyond. At one point, I was frustrated with the paperwork and things weren't going through right and I cried, and he said, ""Listen, I got you. Just email it to me, I'll get it in."" He was very kind.",4

There was another person we worked with. But she was a little bit confusing, but Christine cleared things up, so it was fine. Christine was able to answer any questions that we had. We did a VA loan. They had given us a 5.25 but we had someone else that told us we would get a 5.15, so they were going to match it, but we were never told that we were going to have to pay more in order for them to match it. We ended up having to pay 1,800 out of pocket in order to get that rate. So that part was frustrating. That wasn't really explained well enough to us. They should explain the $500 lock fee better. They made it seem like it was going towards our closing costs, but it just went toward the lock fee.",3

Steve,"Parker, KS","Reviewed Nov. 19, 2022","The application process with AmeriSave seemed like a long time, but after it was all said and done, it wasn’t any lengthier than normal. Travis was super with the application and Randy was super good in Atlanta and returned my phone calls promptly. When I couldn't get ahold of him, I could go back to Travis and he would check with Randy. So, it was competent. They were very patient. I'm an older guy that knew nothing about taking a picture of my license and emailing it and I had a heck of a time with all that. But there was never a tone of impatience. It was a good experience. I probably should have done it nine months before when the rate was low. But I'm satisfied with it. It's locked in during the term of the application, which is nice, because it went up during that time anyway.",5

If I didn't know what I was doing, she was very patient, using the computer to fill out stuff. Also, she replied immediately or she was online with me when I was doing it. She was a million-dollar person. She knew I was refinancing because I had a home equity loan that had doubled in interest. So, it was the perfect time to do it. So, by combining my first mortgage and my second mortgage, the interest rate was lower and the payment was going to be almost $400 less a month. She was wonderful.",5
Baffour,"Appleton, WI","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2022","My interest rate was locked in while I shopped. The process was a little hectic.

It's cleared.” Yet it kept coming back. It gave me anxiety. But at the end of the day, I was happy to go through AmeriSave. They were professionals.

It was up at the end of September, so we had to wait 30 days. Then, when it was time to close, the title company installed something on my file and we had to get that corrected. So, we didn't close on the day that I was supposed to have been closed, but we closed the next day. Instead of waiting to the date of the closing to find something wrong, then getting back with the loan officers at the last minute, the underwriters could have done a better job with that. Our loan officer was also very upset about it and I had to take off of work for that day.",5

Jason,"Mechanicsville, MD","Reviewed Nov. 1, 2022","The refi was great. There was a lot of info that I had to give but the process went smoothly after I gave that. It was easy to get ahold of people when I need to, or if I couldn't, they call back right away. Also, I got a decent rate.",5
Lelia,"Louisville, KY","Reviewed Nov. 1, 2022","The process with AmeriSave was super easy. It took a little bit longer than expected just because my income needed to be verified. But, it was fine. I didn't like the portal online very much. Sometimes it was confusing. If there was a document I needed, I had to search for it. But my loan processor and Emily ended up helping me a lot to get through that. They helped me keep on track of all the documents and stuff I needed to do. They made it super simple. When I asked questions, they made it easy to understand. My rate was also good. I'm happy with it.",5
Braden,"Yuma, AZ","Reviewed Oct. 31, 2022","AmeriSave was really honest with me and super helpful. The process was smooth. There were no setbacks. I originally applied to get pre-approved for a loan in May, but I didn't find the home I wanted to purchase until September. From the day I've seen the offer, the close of Escrow was a little over 30 days. AmeriSave had their stuff together and they had my loan pushed through within two weeks. AmeriSave gave me the best rate possible.",5

Rebeca,"Memphis, TN","Reviewed Oct. 31, 2022","The process with AmeriSave took a lot longer than I thought. The rep said it was a 30-day turnaround but it ended up taking four months. There was a lot of miscommunication with trying to get information. There was a point where they were like, “We can't do it.” Then she called me back and said, “We can do it.” Everything was okay with the experience with the application. However, there were some times on the website, the portal wouldn't let me upload stuff. So I had to send it to my underwriter. The loan originator that helped me throughout was really helpful. Always answered my emails, and my calls. But I came to a halt with the underwriter. I can never get her on the phone or answer emails or try to get information.",4
Nicole,"Kearney, MO","Reviewed Oct. 30, 2022","When the loan officer from AmeriSave called me, I really liked what he had to say. The process with them was super easy. It took 14 days for it to finish. The rate was really great. They actually ended up reducing my rate before it closed. I would tell others to use AmeriSave. I would recommend them to people before they even ask me.",5
Justin,"Somerville, TX","Reviewed Oct. 30, 2022",The rep I was dealing with was really helpful in getting me my first home. He made the process super easy and I didn't feel like I was by myself doing it. My rate was fair.,5

Jennifer,"Hastings, NE","Reviewed Oct. 29, 2022","It's the second time I've used AmeriSave. They're fast. They kept me informed the whole time and answered questions right away. It's just I wanted a 15-year loan, and they made me take a 30. So, I wasn't happy about that but they did say if I pay $500 extra a month, then I will pay it off in 15. So, that's what I'm doing.",5
Wesley,"Sandy Springs, GA","Reviewed Oct. 29, 2022","The process was easy and self-explanatory.

I really enjoyed doing business with him and I’d recommend him to anybody else that was looking to purchase a home. Everything went really smoothly. My rate was perfect and locked in at a beautiful time.",5
Cody,"Abilene, KS","Reviewed Oct. 29, 2022","AmeriSave is a great mortgage company to work with. They have the best rates for me and they provided me with multiple loan options that fit my life and with the area I'm in. The people I worked with were always timely in getting things done for me. If I ever had a question, they were answered quickly. They were always on top of things. They made sure that the tasks I had to complete, I was notified of, as far as I wasn't in the dark. Overall, I was very thrilled with how quickly things moved for them and how streamlined it was. I liked the online application process and the fact that I could fill it all out online in a quick manner. Their online portal for importing things made it simple. Being that AmeriSave is not in Kansas, I never had any face-to-face interaction, so I was able to really utilize their portal.",5
Jonathan,"Orem, UT","Reviewed Oct. 28, 2022","I got connected with Jeff from AmeriSave pretty early on. I grilled Jeff pretty hard, and he was fantastic. He did a really good job at answering all the questions that I had. I was a first-time homebuyer, so I was trying to figure out how the whole mortgage game is played. He was really helpful in saying, “Okay. If you put this amount down for a $400,000 house versus a 450,000 versus a 500,000, here's what you can expect to pay for your payments.” He even found the taxes in areas I was looking at so that I could get pretty accurate numbers there. So, that was really helpful, and it kinda gave me confidence to be able to put an offer in on a home and have an expectation of what I would be paying. AmeriSave was on top of all the paperwork stuff, and we were able to get that a day early too, which was awesome. It was a smooth experience. When I needed something done, it went pretty quickly.",5
David,"Woodstock, GA","Reviewed Oct. 28, 2022",My rep made sure I understood everything and answered all my questions. They picked the best product for me. Give them a shot. They took care of me.,5
Suzanne,"Smyrna, TN","Reviewed Oct. 28, 2022","The process with AmeriSave was frustrating and time-consuming. Their process makes sense if it's a really straightforward type of situation. But for those of us who do not have a straightforward type of situation, their program is not very robust and not very good. They also need a better relationship with their underwriters. But the rep I worked with was a good communicator. He let me know what was going on and everything that I would have expected. He was understanding about some of my frustrations with AmeriSave. Overall, he did a good job. I had no issues with him.",2
Lori,"Santa Ana, CA","Reviewed Oct. 27, 2022","The process with AmeriSave was fast, pretty easy, and very efficient. Everything was done online. So, it went very smoothly. It actually went a lot better than my previous refinance. The fact that everything is online and that you essentially have to just upload documents and that they were able to obtain a lot of things electronically without even bothering me made the process go pretty smoothly. The three people that I dealt with are very responsive. AmeriSave is professional. It's the best refinance experience I've ever had.",5
Nickie,"Olathe, KS","Reviewed Oct. 27, 2022",Working with AmeriSave was a very pleasant experience. The rep walked us through every step and stayed in constant communication with us. Uploading documents was a very easy process. Contact them because they can probably work something out for you and you would be satisfied.,5
Antoinette,"Baltimore, MD","Reviewed Oct. 27, 2022",My experience with AmeriSave was overall amazing. The person I worked with made everything really easy and smooth. He went above and beyond. He checked in. He found out ways why prices were the way that they were. He wanted to make sure I had all the finances. He kept me aware and updated. Everything was simple. Everything that I was told that I would need and have to go through was way less than what I was expecting.,5
Morgan,"Shelby, NC","Reviewed Oct. 26, 2022",AmeriSave was wonderful. The guy and the female that worked with me did a wonderful job. They made sure I was clear on everything that was going on and worked with me when I had complications with understanding this and that. They made it clear to me that I could understand. The process was pretty good. Everything was uploaded just fine. Give AmeriSave a try. They were good for me.,5
Connor,"Cannelton, WV","Reviewed Oct. 26, 2022",Our experience went pretty well. We had a couple of problems that we ran into but we got those figured out. I worked with Blake and he was very good.

David,"Layton, UT","Reviewed Oct. 26, 2022","The rep I worked with was really good about getting back to me whenever they needed something else. She was really professional and knew what she was talking about. There were a lot of hiccups in it, but we worked our way through it all. If I had to refinance again, I definitely would with AmeriSave.",5

Andras,"Hamilton, NJ","Reviewed Oct. 25, 2022","AmeriSave had a great mortgage coordinator. We had a couple of phone calls and he explained everything to me. Very detailed, answered all my questions, and that made my mind that I should work with AmeriSave. I like the transparency and helpfulness, not just saying that, ""Okay, here's the terms, check it,"" but going one by one through each of the lines. Their rates were also the most competitive.",5
William,"New Haven, KY","Reviewed Oct. 25, 2022",AmeriSave answered every one of the questions that I had to ask. They helped me through the application and parts that I didn't understand. They did an excellent job.,5
Sean,"Mountain View, MO","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2022","Thomas, my agent, was quick with any questions. He answered everything and I got the lowest rate that anybody has ever heard of in these times. There were some hiccups but we were able to get through with no problem. I felt reassured through the whole process. AmeriSave was there and they were great. They didn't talk about how much they love veterans and then give me a denial for a stupid reason. It was a fantastic experience.",5
Janit,"Bristol, TN","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2022","We had a great experience with AmeriSave. The application process went well. There were some times we had to get follow-up, but that's normal. Even though there were minor issues, it still went pretty smoothly. Our old mortgage had 15 more years and there's 15-month on this one. So it's a good trade for us. The rep we worked with was also very polite and genuine.",5
David,"Morrison, IL","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2022","AmeriSave's rep was very forthcoming and answered a lot of the questions that I had. I said I was just checking out. She said, “Well, that’s fine. We can do this for you. We can do that. Well, I'll call you tomorrow and see if you could decide anything.” I said, “Well, let's go forward and see what we can do and what we're trying to do.” Then everything kind of rolled from there really quickly and easily. I didn't have any regrets at all. I was a little concerned at the end after everything got passed off from the closing point that the house was paid off, and I didn't hear a whole lot from them. I finally had to make a few phone calls and say, “Hey, am I getting hung up to dry here or what?” Everything worked out fine. Overall, AmeriSave was very professional. I'd recommend them to anybody. They made things painless and they were easy to use.",5

Sylvia,"Ocala, FL","Reviewed Oct. 20, 2022","David, my loan officer, and some of the supporting guys were great. When I had questions, they were attentive and responsive. They helped me resolve any issues I had during the process. I heard a lot about how AmeriSave can help you save money and some of the benefits and it turned out to be true. So I was really thankful for that. Amerisave is the lowest by far that I have had in terms of closing cost.",5
Julie,"Ortonville, MN","Reviewed Oct. 19, 2022","My rep from AmeriSave was awesome. He worked hard. He did stuff our Realtor should have been doing. I am not computer savvy, and he helped us through it. Otherwise, we wouldn't have even known. We knew nothing and it ended up working out. The rates were already going up a little bit. We had it locked in. What we didn't understand was paying down points. It was a short-term loan, and it didn't make sense to pay the points down.",5

I felt confident because I used them back in 2013 to buy a new house, and then to refinance and refinance, and then move again. I felt things got easier because I know the lending officer, Trevor, would be able to follow through. I knew that when he told me something, it was going to happen. Everything went well. As far as the rates and terms, it was good, given the whole circumstance of rates going up and my credit. It definitely beat out the builder who wanted to give me higher closing costs. The whole package with AmeriSave is better.",5

It got to be a little frustrating at one point because they kept asking for a document that I could not provide because it didn't exist. No matter how hard I tried to explain it, it didn't seem to matter. So, what ended up happening was they ended up calling. I had to do a three-way call with Equifax for this one account, because for this one account, they wanted statements for a period of time that there were no statements ‘cause I didn't owe them any money. But I could not make AmeriSave understand that, so I ended up having to do a three-way call with Equifax and the bank and AmeriSave to clear this up. It was frustrating.",3
Mia,"Dallas, GA","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2022","The loan officer was great. Jeffrey, who was the originator, was also great and pretty responsive. I put in the documents through the portal. It took me a minute to figure out that looking at it on my phone was different from if I got to a desktop. On the phone, you can see the information and you can upload things. But on the desktop, it will show you the status. On the phone, it didn't show you the status. Other than that, Amerisave worked to try to get everything taken care of. The initial date to close had to be pushed back for two weeks, but everything still was done within that second time frame. So that was fine.",5

She's from North Carolina, and she was the branch manager. She did a really good job. She tried everything and worked so hard for a month and a half before she got me this mortgage so I can have my own place to buy. This was great because four companies, even my own bank, refused to give me anything.",5

I got frustrated a few times, but they were very level-headed and never got frustrated with me. They continued to work for me and answered all the underwriter's questions, which were absolutely ridiculous. They were pretty quick getting back to me. They locked my interest rate in for almost two months. The people were very easy to work with. They were very pleasant at all times. This is the first time I've done it on the internet so much and I'm 71 and not necessarily that internet-techy. All in all, I'm very pleased with what they gave me.",5

I expressed to her that if I can get this done, I'm turning around with the cash-out system that I got extra out of equity that I could use. I was paying all my utilities up for one whole year and I did. She completed her end of it, which was fabulous. I wrote to Amerisave that she was God’s angel that got sent to me.

I had another loan officer whom I started with, but from the information that I got from AmeriSave, the person that helped me was providing more details, more information, and more guidance. I decided to end the relationship with the other mortgage place and went with AmeriSave because I was getting more guidance as a first-time homeowner. I had a lot of questions that I wasn't getting answers from the other place.",5
Christopher,"Fremont, NE","Reviewed Oct. 8, 2022","The experience with AmeriSave was a unique one since it was my wife and I's first time doing it all online.

The process took less than a month from beginning to end. They were good and I would recommend them.",5
Jason,"Boise, ID","Reviewed Oct. 7, 2022","The application process at AmeriSave was really simple. I just had to provide some documentation, such as proof of salary and my job. It took just a day or two. It was really fast. However, I did a cash-out refinance, and the check I was sent had a name that was misspelled, and it took three phone calls to get that squared away. Even when I called their customer service, no one picked up, on three different occasions, even though I called during the hours of operation. But then, once I got ahold of someone, she was awesome and she took care of it that day. I also worked with Todd and what I liked about him was he knew his stuff, wasn't trying to jerk me around, and just was black and white on the whole process. Didn't seem like your typical car salesman. ""I don't really care. I just wanna get you into a loan."" If I went with AmeriSave again, I would try to work with Todd.",5

If he didn't have the answer, he will find out the answer and always get back to me. He never left me hanging so definitely appreciated his customer service. Rob was really good to me so felt really comfortable doing business with AmeriSave. Also, the rates and terms of the mortgage were right where I wanted to be monthly-wise.",5

He stayed on the phone with me, answering every question as I filled out my application. Nobody else made sure I understood everything before they moved forward. Bart and Denise held my hand and walked me through everything. We stayed on the phone together. They stayed calm. I had an incident where my brother was gifting me funds and the bank he was dealing with refused to stamp and sign his bank statement. Denise offered to talk to them for me. She was never rude to them. As soon as Denise politely talked to the lady and pointed out some very serious rules she was violating, she took care of it. ",5

That delayed us and my closing cost went from 8,000 to 12,000. But the rep we worked with, Steven, bent over backward. He was as frustrated as we were at that type of stuff. He even tried to help us find company. He was amazing. If anyone asks about AmeriSave, I would refer them straight to Steven and I would tell them to use AmeriSave.",4

It's cost me more to email this back and forth than that $100 is worth. I don't understand why I gotta jump through all these hoops to say why I lost $100 and it was about two days wasted on me.

He was polite and responsive. I liked the website. It was like a to-do list. We've done mortgages before, so I had an idea what would be needed so the rep didn't have to start from scratch with me, but it was very easy to go through the site. The experience with AmeriSave was thorough and fast. We had the money in less than a month.

Everyone was in communication all the time and in the portal, it was very easy to know what documents I needed to send in and to upload them. The rep I worked with would text me if there was anything going on and he was always available, even late at night too. AmeriSave made it super easy to get a mortgage and it was a great rate, better than I could get anywhere else.",5
Edwin,"Lawton, OK","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2022",The loan process with AmeriSave was easy and it took about two months from start to finish. The rates and terms were cool and the communication was good.,5
Rick,"Fairhope, AL","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2022","We've used AmeriSave in the past and we were satisfied with what they did for us then and they had good rates at the time. This time, I got a conventional loan for a home purchase and it was great. Josh, the rep, was very helpful and personable. I enjoyed working with him and I was impressed with his knowledge of the process. The rate and terms of the mortgage was competitive and I have no complaints on that. I would give AmeriSave a thumbs up. They did a good job and so far, we're happy with what we've seen.",5
D.,"Fl, FL","Reviewed Sept. 25, 2022","I was not happy with my experience with AmeriSave. They made me get documents that were totally unnecessary and waited till after I gave them all the documents to let me know I didn't need them. I bought my house and I listed my house on a Friday night. It was sold on Saturday and then, I bought this house. The purchase of my house was in 19 days and the people were paying cash. So I didn't have time to play with stupidity, which I got from AmeriSave. I usually have multiple houses at the same time because I live in Florida and I've never dealt with underwriters that were so incompetent. They asked me for so much stuff in the most incompetent manner, it was ungodly. They asked me for my tax returns for two years for my businesses that I have and I have been, in my entire life, a W-2 employee. They didn't know what they were doing. ",2
Mark,"Cathedral City, CA","Reviewed Sept. 25, 2022","The application itself with AmeriSave was not difficult but the loan process was a nightmare. Their system was horrible. It asked for a bank statement so I sent them one. I got a couple of questions about some of my things on my bank statement and I answered those. Then, four days later, I got something else on the same bank statement that they already had for a week. And two or three weeks later, they were still asking me questions about the bank statement. It seemed to drag things out a lot longer than it needed to be. They kept blaming the FHA process, but it was on them. Then, they made some mistakes in calculations. So, they were trying to put me on a rate increase a couple of times. And I ended up having to take one just to get the loan done on the day of closing. They came back and the closing cost was $4,000 higher than they originally said, which changed the amount of money in my account that I needed to have in my account.",2
Ashley,"Goodyear, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2022","I did a refinance with Lindsey, the rep, maybe a year ago and it was done within two weeks. It was very quick and amazing. But this time, the process with AmeriSave was all over the place and the communication was not good at all with the other people I was dealing with. They could have improved on it. The underwriters kept asking me for the same information over and over. That was very annoying.",1
Christin,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2022","I got a 30-year fixed loan from AmeriSave and the online application process was pretty easy. There was one document that was huge when I had to sign it and return it. But for whatever reason, the site wouldn't take it, so I just emailed it to my representative. Todd has been very easy to work with and pretty upfront. He was transparent about what needed to happen. So that was easy for me.",5

K.,"Fl, FL","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2022","AmeriSave Mortgage got everything done that needed to be done and got to where I needed closing to be. Everybody was on top of everything and they requested the documents that they needed. And if there were any changes that needed to be made, they requested it immediately. So, it was a good process. Also, the rate was locked in and it was better than anything else out there and no one else could compete with it. Overall, it's a good company. They're not well advertised, but maybe that's how they get away with getting some better interest rates, because they don't advertise like some of the big corporations like Rocket Mortgage and Quicken Loans. It was smooth and an easy process to get through.",5

Elizabeth,"Cleveland, TX","Reviewed Sept. 21, 2022","I was matched with AmeriSave. The process was very easy and I loved it. The rates I got were better than what I expected. Instead of 30 years, I got 15 years. I'm super excited about that.",5
Aretha,"Troy, AL","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2022","AmeriSave reached out to me. When I got with them, they told me everything from 1 to Z. They were a really good company to work with.

Carolyn,"St Paul, MN","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2022","I really loved the loan officer that I worked with. She was incredible and amazing. She was very responsive. She would get ahold of me right away. She would tell me what was going on. So, a lot of times, I just went through her. Their underwriting department though could use a little work. Somebody took out all the numbers and all the information on my loan and plugged in other information from out of thin air. At one point, I had them telling me that, I wasn't going to qualify for the mortgage after it had already been fully approved. My heart plummeted. I had about 24 hours of wondering what the heck was going on, and if the sale of my house wasn't going to go through. And this was very close to when I was supposed to be moving into the house and closing.",2
Amir,"Maricopa, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2022",I had a really bad experience with AmeriSave. Customer service was really poor. Nobody picks up the phone and there's a long wait. The timely response was really lagging on inquiries. There were tons and tons of documentation I need to fill out. I own four other properties. I've never had to go through that experience where AmeriSave would ask for documents that were beyond my recognition. This is based on my recollection of what I've done with the earlier lenders.,1
Billy,"Texarkana, AR","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2022","Shana was great and very helpful. Even the underwriter, Chris, was great and very to the point. I was scared ‘cause everybody's saying how big of a pain it is to get a mortgage. But it worked out well. Overall, I would recommend them to anybody else. I just don't like all the junk mail I'm getting saying I gotta contact AmeriSave. But other than that, it's all right.",5
Trellis,"Carrollton, GA","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2022",The process with AmeriSave was extremely easy. I had a young lady call me out with questions and to do the basic stuff. They set me up with the stuff to go online and just for documentation if I had to submit anything. The process was fairly fast. The whole process from getting approved by the appraiser took about three weeks. ,5
David,"Champaign, IL","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2022","It was really good working with AmeriSave. When I called, I talked to a young lady named Shoanna. She explained everything to me and how they can save me a little bit more money than this other company that I was trying to go to. She also gave me a better quote than the other company. I also talked with them about closing out. They sent the notary over there. The notary explained everything that was going on. We signed papers and the deal was done. They were with me every step of the way. It was a wonderful experience for me.",5
Keith,"Vernon Hills, IL","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2022","We were initially going with Rocket but due to a paperwork snafu on the fourth of July holiday weekend, we were frantically trying to find an alternative provider. AmeriSave stayed late on the Friday of a holiday weekend to help us get things going and they were awesome. The application process was very straightforward and simple. I mostly was interacting with the loan originator and the processing team. The loan originator was Wes and he was incredible. We were then working with a secondary person, Sarah, and she was very responsive. On the whole, I was very impressed with the process. The only thing was the rates were disappointingly high, all things considered, but they were better than the competition. AmeriSave beat the other provider with comparable terms on points and origination fees. The interest rate was almost four tenths of a point better.",5
Michael,"Jefferson City, MO","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2022","We were going through the home buying process. I had a preferred lender I was working with but his closing costs seemed a bit high. I went on some kind of website where you can shop lenders, put in my information, and AmeriSave was the first one to give me a phone call within 10 minutes. Ever since then, it was such a great experience and I continue to work with them.",5
Carlos,"Apex, NC","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2022","I went through a website and did a comparison of different banks that would give the best rates. AmeriSave was the top one so it was an easy decision for us to go with them. They had an easy process. It was just a matter of answering a few questions and giving out my credit. Basing off my credit and my debt ratio, it was a no-brainer for them to accept us and they went ahead and did the loan for us.",5
Mary,"Hillsboro, VA","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2022","AmeriSave called me when I inputted my loan request. I stayed on the line and their guy Gil gave us a better rate and credits compared to anybody else we talked to. The application process was good and so was the loan officer. He made sure we got a good deal and that we got a good processor. The mortgage processor was very responsive. The only thing was the underwriter was a little more aggressive and a pain in the butt than any other underwriters I've dealt with in all my many purchases and refinances. That aside, the rates were good. The process took about a month.",5
Patty,"Webster, MA","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2022","Mark from AmeriSave was great. I told him the situation and he told me right off the bat if I could or could not do the program. We did the VA loan and we refinanced through the VA loan. We took a little bit of cash out and we just paid off the new roof that we got. The process with AmeriSave took about a month and Mark stayed right on top of everything. If there was something that was missing or something that I said that wasn't right on there, he corrected it and found out why. The mortgage company we had before this one stressed me out. But with AmeriSave, I didn't have to worry about too much of anything. If Mark asked for something, I did it and if I couldn't find it, he helped me find it. Also, if I didn't know how to do a certain thing, I gave him permission to jump on with me on my computer on AmeriSave and he walked me right through it. It was so easy to do.",5
Moriah,"Knoxville, TN","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2022","I did AmeriSave to lock in the interest rate as it was pretty good. My loan rep was very helpful and he was able to answer all of our questions.

All in all, everything was fine.",5
Carroll,"Tampa, FL","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2022","For some reason, one of the lending agencies had misinformation and I don't know where they got it from. I asked them about that and they were very strong that the information was correct and it had a negative effect on my credit file. I said, ""I have an excellent credit right now. I don't know what you're talking about."" They said, ""Well, they found this and we hope that you can get this corrected."" I had no idea what they were talking about. I even went down to the court to get anything cleared up and saw I have nothing. Sometimes there might be something that might be in there and there was nothing there. That was with Royal out of Indianapolis. I said, ""Well, that doesn't even sound right. What I'm doing is building a new garage.""",5
Arthur,"San Tan Valley, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2022","The process at AmeriSave went very smoothly. Ernest did a really good job for me. We ended up being able to close early. The hiccups that we had was with their web page. It's not as polished as it ought to be. I went in and created an account as soon as I was able to do that, but because the application hasn't officially made it to their system yet, that account ended up not being used, and Ernest had to create a new account. Because of that, because I was trying to be proactive, every time I logged in, there were two accounts, I had to make sure I pick the right one. The other one just didn't go away all that soon.",5
Nicholas,"Deville, LA","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2022","AmeriSave is number 2 out of the top three best mortgage lenders. I called the first people but their percentages were bad. They wanted 5.7% APR. I called AmeriSave and I got 1.75. I ended up paying the $500 and locked it in. I'm happy. That's the cheapest. I worked with Curtis and Natasha, and they were amazing. Jessica was also sweet. They were patient and very informative. They would give you the link easily through their email to get into the website to go through the document. It was such an easy breeze. If I had any issues, I'd be in contact with Curtis and he would tell me, ""Don't worry about it. As soon as you get time, try to get done within a week and we'll go ahead and try to bypass everything."" I appreciated that. I'm gonna use AmeriSave again.",5

Simon,"Hooksett, NH","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2022","Everybody at AmeriSave was very helpful and great. I worked with Christine and she was awesome and can't recommend her enough. She always seemed positive on the phone and very nice. However, the emails for whenever anybody enters anything in the portal, they're written to make it seem like it's the end of the world and that it was urgent. But when you check what it is, it's stuff that they didn't need until when you actually found a house. But overall, I'm very happy with the process.",5
Brent,"Shelbyville, TN","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2022","Cory, the rep I worked with at AmeriSave, told me that he would let me know if he needed any other paperwork other than whatever I turned in. By working with Cory, I didn't have the bad experience that some of the others had, and that is the continual emails telling you to turn in the same paperwork over and over. My experience was good. Other than, I called Cory several times to reiterate that I was getting all these emails, and he reiterated back to me that, ""Don't worry about it. They're just automatic emails.""

I really appreciate his honesty and even every step far as finding out where the money came from, from my pension. Also, especially when I'm a first-time buyer too and we don't know the ins and outs. Doing the portal was also no problem. Even doing the documents was good. It's just that when certain stuff he asked for, it didn't let you put it in there unless you go through other documents.",5

Blake's awesome. He was the rep we worked with and he was helpful, friendly, and supportive.

Lewis,"Oviedo, FL","Reviewed Sept. 3, 2022","The process was smooth once everything was pre-approved. Christine was my agent with AmeriSave and she did a fantastic job with helping us through the whole process. We moved quickly and ended up closing in a very short amount of time (two and a half weeks). There was a lot of information and documentation in a very short amount of time. My only complaint was there was something that popped up and I wasn't notified until the 11th hour. Once that happened, with hitting our closing date, the problem became having to go through with JP Morgan and getting things cleared up from them. It was a hassle. I wish that we would have known about it earlier, so we could have been ahead of the game on that. If it would have been a normal 30-day close, that would have been something that could have been handled with more than enough time. There were certain individuals during the process that could have been a little bit more receptive or communicated better.",4

Even after-hours, he would call me back or send me a message if he was on another phone call. He was hands down one of the best people I’ve worked with. However, my underwriter was a little difficult. They would continuously delete items that they said they needed. Instead of calling me, they continued to delete items. At closing, they called to tell me they still weren't finished with the paperwork. They said they needed to call my boss and didn't have her number. Why didn't they ask me that previously instead of two hours after I was supposed to close? AmeriSave gave me one of the best rates but unfortunately, as I was getting ready to close, the rates dropped again, so I didn't qualify because the paperwork was already done.",4

Curtis took down my information and said,  “Here, let me go see and give you the final deal.” In 15 minutes, he gave me a hard estimate and all the numbers that I was looking for. He gave me the rate, terms, and closing time. ",5

Any other time I buy a home, I'll probably be going through AmeriSave.",5

There were a couple of things that came up that I had to do but they worked with me and I was very pleased with them. The application process was easy. Rocket Mortgage contacted me and said, “Well, I can go a better interest rate.” It was a half point down. But AmeriSave said, “Well, we can match that.” They were very truthful in what they did.",5

I had each one calling me for the same information and the very next day, they'd be calling me for the next thing. It started getting really annoying and very frustrating. It was a lot of repetitive paperwork and there were people calling me that I didn't know were involved in the process. I dealt with Justin in the beginning and if anything else needed to come to AmeriSave, it would have gone through him but everybody kept calling me direct instead. And I wasn't notified who would be calling me. It felt like random people were calling me at different times. It seemed like internal communication was not there but they were all perfectly nice, though.",4

She kept communicating with me all the time, and she told me a lot of things proactively, like how these things are processed and what kind she needs, any document and other things. Also, the AmeriSave online tool that I used was straightforward, and I was able to upload all the necessary documents and keep checking with the references.

Their communication was a little slower than I expected because the lender, Mish, was so on pace. I was able to speak with him whenever I felt like it. I was also able to send him a text or email and he was fast to respond. Whenever I couldn't get in touch with the underwriter, I'll reach out to him. Mish was able to work things out in a manner of getting us a loan, making phone calls between the seller and myself, just trying to make the deal work.

If Quentin didn't know the answer, he would research it and get back to me within a day or two. However, the process was a bit longer than we thought because of other issues. Right before closing, there were things that slipped through the cracks that shouldn't have. The closing agent could have done a little better on their part.

The loan originator was Michael ** who made us feel comfortable and said all the right things to go forward with the loan. We locked in the rate at 3.5% but weeks later the communication became poor and was difficult to get status on the loan. The loan dragged on for 4 months with constant excuses for more documents that they already had. Once we got that notice the loan was ready to finalize, we received disclosures with no discounts and a higher rate. Obviously, we're not happy and before we could get Amerisave on the phone, a notary agent was scheduled to arrive at our home that day to sign loan documents.

I was saving cash on hand and then depositing through my account as soon as I was able to get the loan. Depositing those large amounts was one of my big mistakes.

Demetrio,"Bakersfield, CA","Reviewed July 12, 2022","AmeriSave Mortgage is the worst company I have ever worked with. This would be my third time. The two last time that I worked with them here in California, they were great. But the one in Indiana, the one that’s doing my loan, is horrible in every aspect. When I have questions regarding the loan, they do not respond. The initial person that was running my loan, left the job, went somewhere else. Nobody told us that he was no longer an employee there until we called, and we wanted to speak with the supervisor. That was when they told us that he got another job. But nobody took the time to let us know what was going on. We're supposed to close on the 22nd. AmeriSave now finds other things that are delaying the approval. It's ridiculous.",1
John,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed July 11, 2022",A lot of the process was done over the phone. Communication was great. We had a knowledgeable service rep. We’re happy with our service.,5
Juan Pablo,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed July 11, 2022","I received a call from the AmeriSave agent that was working with me and he was very detailed and he provided me with all the information. He gave me all the options on how we could achieve my goal at the time. Also, he suggested we could lock our rate and I'm glad we did that because the interest rates were rising up. I'm glad he made me take that decision without being pushy. He was very responsive. He was very helpful in providing me with wise suggestions that I could take in order to take the best deal possible. The overall process with AmeriSave was easy. When we were about to close, I didn't know I needed to have the closing cost. They needed to be in my bank account at least two months before. Otherwise, that could have been questioned during the appraisal process, and I didn't know that at that time. So, it was a bit tricky, but we could manage it. I just wish I knew that in advance.",5
Veronica,"San Jacinto, CA","Reviewed July 10, 2022","I qualified for FHA and I did that with AmeriSave. The loan originator that I had knew his job and how to deal with customers. He helped a lot. I had questions and I would email. He answered them promptly and he explained everything. If you call him and he was not there, you can leave a message and he would be calling first thing in the morning. He was always there. You never felt like you were left hanging. I was impressed by that as well as his patience. ",5
Jantzen,"Dallas, TX","Reviewed July 10, 2022","I'm very satisfied with AmeriSave Mortgage. But the paperwork was a hassle because they kept requesting multiple things that I had sent in. And communication was a little slow. Other than that, it was good.",3
Christian,"Beaufort, SC","Reviewed July 9, 2022","AmeriSave had the better offer out on the table. Compared to past experiences with refinances and purchasing a home, it’s a lot easier and more streamlined. AmeriSave didn't keep on asking me for more and more. They were upfront. “This is what we need. You guys send this to us, and we'll be able to get everything on our way.” Also, I got a call at least two or three times a week giving me updates.",5
Keith,"Los Lunas, NM","Reviewed July 9, 2022","I was trying to refinance through a local bank and they wouldn't work with me. AmeriSave kept calling and I just sat on the phone one day and talked to their guy. He was super cool. The application process was easy because I had already been through the process and I knew everything I needed. I had gotten a new job and they were willing to work with me. If I didn't know all the stuff I needed right off the bat, it would have been a little hard because everything was done through email and scanning. It’s a little easier in person but I had everything together so I was able to scan 90% of the documents and get them over to AmeriSave.",5
Ryan,"Lakewood, CO","Reviewed July 8, 2022","I was attracted to AmeriSave Mortgage's Lock & Shop program. Not everybody offers that. That was helpful. And the process itself was thorough. The response was quick. My communication throughout was typically by phone, email, and well. The rate was locked in quickly, between AmeriSave and I, and the agreement was what it ended up being. There were a few what I would consider hidden fees that I was not aware of that AmeriSave tacked on, so not the best experience there.",4
Lindsay,"Madisonville, KY","Reviewed July 6, 2022","Everybody we worked with from AmeriSave was awesome. They were really efficient in getting back to us with questions. They were very knowledgeable and did everything that they could to make the process as easy as possible for us. We had issues with uploading documents at the very beginning, but they said that the website had just gone under some reconstruction, and then we didn't have any issues after that. I would recommend the company to anybody. We had a really great experience.",5
Debra,"Eminence, KY","Reviewed July 6, 2022","Rocket Mortgage kept denying me. When they found out that I was refinancing, they offered me a lower rate. When I told AmeriSave that I was gonna stay with Rocket Mortgage, they said to send them what AmeriSave offered. I did, and they met everything. It was under 30 days from beginning to end to get it done. It gets stressful sometimes. Anytime you refinance or get a new loan, they keep asking for stuff but I understand that. In the end, it all worked out. It was a wonderful experience to work with AmeriSave. They went above and beyond and got me what I wanted and needed.",5
Deborah,"Sugar Hill, GA","Reviewed July 5, 2022","Our experience with AmeriSave was the best ever. We’ve never had such an easy and fast experience in our entire life. We thought it was a scam. It was so unreal. There was a great transition. Everybody was so kind. They sent the guy out here to sign the papers. He was awesome. It was unbelievable how wonderful it went. The application was really easy. Beatrice went through the whole thing. We did it all over the phone. It was really quick because she called me that day that I filled it out, and we had already signed the paper and had everything going. Within a week, we already were done. I was impressed with how easy it was to work with Beatrice and how she stayed on top of it. I love the AmeriSave portal because it would prompt me to do things, and Beatrice or her staff would email me and say, “Oh, you need to put this back up there. This needs to be on there.” She was fabulous. She was so sweet, so kind, and so patient.",5
Kylie,"Valparaiso, IN","Reviewed July 5, 2022","AmeriSave had the best interest rates. The main thing that sold us with them was they did have the 90-day lock interest rate. We knew we were gonna be closing around June and we're trying to lock in because we knew the rates were going up. They did promise us that, which they almost did lose at first with us, once we went with them. I was like, “You promised us.” They kept their word, but the rep had to really do some work for it. ",5
Warren,"Portsmouth, VA","Reviewed July 4, 2022","Over the past week, things with AmeriSave have been life-changing for the better. With the whole refinance procedure, I studied the process and it was a little longer than I expected. A lot of the information that they were requesting of me and re-requesting of me seemed very redundant. There was stuff that I had already sent in the past. They wanted me to update it. I’d update it and they’d say, “Well, we need additional documentation to support what you're sending.” I’d send that and they’d go, “Okay. Well, where did this come from? We need documents to support this.” So, that part was a little rough and stressful. Outside of that, the agent that I worked with was excellent, very patient, and helped me out with the whole procedure. Her name was Tracy.",4
Shakree,"Rock Hill, SC","Reviewed July 4, 2022","AmeriSave was an awesome company, and I had a great experience. It was a very easy process. Their reps were there to let me know what was needed. It was very simple to upload them. Any questions I had, they were there to answer. Working with AmeriSave was worth a try. I have no regrets. It was a very quick process as well, but still without feeling rushed. You can't beat that.",5
Laura,"Mchenry, IL","Reviewed July 3, 2022","AmeriSave was good and efficient. I looked up several different companies and AmeriSave had a good reputation from what I saw. I did a re-mortgage. I just had to fill some paperwork out, and it took about a week and a half to get it all done. I did everything over the phone and online, and I had the money and everything by the time I was done within a month. Gabriella was great. Even on her day off, she got answers to me even though my response time backed from the email so she was out of the office.",4
Ritty,"Ewing, NJ","Reviewed July 3, 2022","AmeriSave's reps were very nice and very patient with me. There were a lot of things that I didn't understand. I'm retired and my computer experience is not bad, but it's not that good. And they worked with me and I learned a lot, too.",5
Christy,"Orange, VA","Reviewed July 2, 2022","AmeriSave had the best rate and what we were looking for. The rep was very knowledgeable. He knew everything, and he could answer all the questions and everything that I needed. He was very informative, kept in contact anytime I needed anything and really quick to answer for anything that I needed. From start to finish, it was a great experience. We're not too happy with the rate but considering the economy at this time and inflation, we kind of understood the rate. The terms were good, too.",5
Casey,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed July 2, 2022","AmeriSave does a lock rate for 90 days and there are people online that have complained that it was a bait-and-switch.

Patrick,"Jacksonville, FL","Reviewed July 1, 2022",The rep was fantastic and responded almost immediately whenever I had any questions. The rate and terms were fantastic. It's exactly what I needed.

Stacia,"Walkersville, MD","Reviewed June 30, 2022","My loan originator, Jason, was the quickest to respond when I needed things. He was always available whenever I needed to speak with him and I appreciate that. Sometimes it’s after office hours or on a weekend. The rate and terms were very competitive. I had a couple other lenders that wanted to try to compete so there was a little back and forth. But AmeriSave matched the best deal that I was given. Once we got into the loan disclosures, there were some mistakes that I caught. It was more the loan processor type. So, AmeriSave should pay a little more attention to detail. I still would have gone through everything with a fine-toothed comb, but there were things in there that I shouldn't have had to point out. They should’ve been on top of that.",4
Joshua,"Kahului, HI","Reviewed June 30, 2022","AmeriSave responded quickly and was right on top of everything. Any time I had a question, I didn't have to wait nor go through any hoops just to get an answer. It was my first experience and the rep broke it down for me where I could understand everything. If I had questions, I would email the person and he would either call me back or email me a time where he could call me. AmeriSave did everything to the tee and they asked for all the legal documents so everything would run smoothly. And I appreciated all that. I didn't have to do any shortcuts. Financially, working with AmeriSave helped us out in the long run so it impacted well.",5
Jason,"Odessa, FL","Reviewed June 29, 2022","The process of refinancing was good and fast. I would recommend it. The new rate and terms were right in line with the national averages, so I didn't have an issue with that. It was a good experience with AmeriSave.",5

Tai,"Cypress, TX","Reviewed June 28, 2022","AmeriSave is a good company and my experience with them was great. You go through certain steps of the refinancing and different people take over but I was able to call the same person from the beginning. All my questions were answered and they were informative. I could call them at any time or even text them, and they were able to help me through the whole process. Any time I was confused, I could call even the original person who I talked to.",5
Jeet,"Oakland, CA","Reviewed June 27, 2022","AmeriSave just asked for my pay stub and I already had the pre-approval within the same day. Plus, the agents were professional and the email responses were very prompt and fast. The origination fees were a little bit on the higher side and the rate could have been a bit better. But there was so much of fluctuation at the time, so it is what it is. So, I’ll probably just need to refinance when the time is right. But overall, in terms of experience and the way it was handled, it was amazing. ",4
Roberto,"Bakersfield, CA","Reviewed June 27, 2022","I've been very pleased with my experience with AmeriSave. I got a loan for an investment and for the most part, the process went okay. In the beginning, I was in the blank. But everything came out as they promised in the end. The application and underwriting process took around 40 days. It was fast. The rep persevered with me because I was looking into other lending institutions and she was right there to convince me that AmeriSave could do a better job. The rates were competitive. They were within the mark and possibly among the best.",5
Mohamed,"Lewisville, TX","Reviewed June 26, 2022","AmeriSave had the best rate out of the six other companies I was talking to. They also gave me the ability to lock my rate.

She was pretty much like my assistant.",5
Housam,"Livonia, MI","Reviewed June 26, 2022","Zee, the rep I worked with at AmeriSave, was great.

The rate and terms were not the best based on the amount that I'm borrowing. It’s less than 100,000 and the interest rate was higher. But the monthly payment is low, which worked out.",5
Cindy,"Coleraine, MN","Reviewed June 25, 2022","AmeriSave had the best rate and terms for us. They were higher as expected.

James,"Cambria, IL","Reviewed June 24, 2022","AmeriSave was better than the other two companies that I considered. Also, when I called them, I got ahold of a guy named Bo and he made the whole thing so easy. It worked out great for us. Their reps were really informed and any question I had, they were right on top of it. If they did not know the answer, they would get right back with me quickly. Everything that they needed was easy to get. If we had any questions about what we needed, we'd call them and they’d be specific about what we needed. And it was a lot easier to do it like that. The application and the underwriting process took around 40 days and all in all, they were perfect the way they were. I also worked with Cynthia and she was my processor. She was very friendly to deal with and was as knowledgeable as Bo was. She made the experience easy, too. AmeriSave is the only place that I would go to and I wouldn't go anywhere else. With them, I got everything you could ask for from a lender.",5

The rates and terms were also great, especially after shopping around.",5
Ron,"Winter Garden, FL","Reviewed June 23, 2022","The rep from AmeriSave was good and on top of the game. I just got confused a lot of times because there were two of them talking. But they fixed it. The application process was smooth and everything was on point. They gave the guidance that I needed to get all the documents. I expected the rate to be a little bit lower because the first rate they told me was low. But it went up. They told me it was higher because of the appraisal of my house that happened. Still, AmeriSave is a good company because I recommended it to my friend. I'm still getting mail though that I need to call but I don’t know what those are. The loan originator told me not to answer those and not to call the numbers. There were three different mails. It was the same company but different numbers. So, I'm confused. She emailed her team and CC’d me but I didn’t get any feedback about it so I just let it go.",5
Denise,"Fayetteville, NC","Reviewed June 22, 2022","I was trying to get two houses but I never got the first house because the inspection didn’t go well. The person who assisted was fine on that one but on the house that I ended up purchasing, which was the last one, the assistant for it was just very confused and there were times that she would call me about things or ask for information that I had already submitted or I had talked to the rep about. It got to the point where I was taking her calls and they were coming on a daily basis and then other people were calling because, apparently, she was out and they were as clueless as she was. So, that part was not good. But Dan, the rep, was excellent and amazing. I'm a first-time homebuyer and didn't have much information about what to expect. He was extremely helpful, informative and approachable. I couldn't have done it without him and couldn't imagine working with anybody else. I have already started sharing his contact information.",4

Everything was great aside from I didn't see my closing documents, and I had to pay the annual insurance upfront. I was told that that would just be taken out of my lump sum, cash out refi. More clarity would be nice. Also, I'm still trying to figure it out, but it looks like I have to pay a year’s insurance premium. But it's not a big deal.",5

I was told he quit. But the last one, Darla, sped things up and got it through. They took so long though to get everything done that the rates kept going up. When I started out, the rate was 3.75 and it wound up I was going to be paying 4.50.",4
Nicholas,"Spring, TX","Reviewed June 21, 2022","The application is super easy. Also, everybody is very responsive. Nick, the loan officer I worked with, had a couple of times when the underwriters approved then didn't. That was the only headache, with the underwriters needing additional information that we have already sent. And they would say, ""Hey, it's already sent.""  So, it took a bit longer because of that. But the loan officer was fantastic. The rate is a solid rate, and the terms is good, too. Keep an eye on your email because AmeriSave may need something updated. Other than that, you will be taken care of.",5
Marilyn,"Knoxville, TN","Reviewed June 21, 2022","The lady who called me, Joanna, was great. I would recommend her to anybody. I had talked to a couple of men, and one of them was good, one of them was just trying to make a deal, and the other was a complete and utter jerk and kept lying to me. Joanna helped me figure out what was going on and work it all out. She was very honest. She said, ""This is your next 30 years, so this is something we need to work out for you, how it's right for you."" I explained to her what the other people have told me. She told me it was not right then explained why they said it. She told me I might still get a better deal somewhere and that's 100% to me. She didn't push me or my husband to sign the papers. She gave us time to talk it over. She said, ""I'm gonna give you the options, what we can do, and you take it and decide what you want to do with it."" Whereas the last guy said, ""I'm not even gonna give you a loan estimate unless you 100%.",5
Joseph,"Cypress, CA","Reviewed June 20, 2022","I researched three of the larger companies, like LoanDepot and Rocket Mortgage, and what really attracted me to AmeriSave was the fact that we could buy our interest rate down.

In addition to the good customer service, I stayed with AmeriSave because of the good rates. I was able to get some cash out for some other things. If I had a frustration, it was that they are way out east so my timeframe was so different from theirs. Sometimes, I couldn't reach people. Other than that, if there is such a thing as a good experience on a refi, this would be it.",5
Michael,"Talkeetna, AK","Reviewed June 18, 2022","The process took a while which was both our faults. Otherwise, it was very pleasant. Sometimes I couldn't get a call back but maybe the rep didn't get the message. I dealt with Jessica and she was very professional.",5

He had several assistants that would periodically check in with me. Everybody was very good at communicating and keeping me informed of the process. Plus, AmeriSave’s rates were competitive and they made the process fairly easy. It's never easy when you're getting a mortgage because of the information that's required but they have a portal system where I could upload documents that have been requested. Sometimes though, it took a few days before that information request would clear on the portal. If they can make that a little more prompt, that would be better.",5

Two days later, the gentleman from the mortgage company or the title company showed up at our house and we signed all the paperwork. The other mortgage had been paid off as well as one of the other bills and we were all set to go. It was a very fantastic and nice experience. AmeriSave got us a better interest rate.

I've used them six to eight times in the past for refis and purchases and that's been my general experience so I keep coming back. Also, the rates were reasonable. It's pretty transparent and it seems reasonably competitive. The biggest wait was for the appraisal to close everything out.

The idea of going through all the process is kind of daunting but working with AmeriSave makes it relatively painless.",4

Everything moved along at the speed of sound. Then, it went over to the processor and he was very good too but he was held up by some things. Our house was in a trust and I had to go to the attorney and have it taken out of the trust. After the mortgage was done, we had to put it back in the trust. So there was a lot of steps we had to go through. But he would call me at 7 o'clock at night or on Sunday. The poor guy was working all the time. But he was very good trying to move things along.",4

Everything that Amerisave asked me to do was reasonable. They got back to me in a timely manner, which was a big deal for me. I shopped around for a little while, and Amerisave had a comparable rate to everything that I saw. It was a lot less than a couple of the larger banks that I had inquired about.",5

Garry,"Yukon, OK","Reviewed June 10, 2022","The process with AmeriSave was easier than any other lending institution I've ever worked with before. But there was one part of the process where they kept asking me for bank statements that reflected a certain amount of money that they needed to see for the loan to be processed more smoothly. What they didn't get was that we had to put earnest money down, which would have gone for the closing. That was one main thing in the process that could have been improved. It was kind of frustrating because I couldn't get them to see that the money isn't going to reflect in the account.",5

Kenneth,"Martinsburg, WV","Reviewed June 9, 2022","AmeriSave did a really good job on the refinancing process. I didn't have to go out and go anywhere or do anything. The biggest problem I had was with the appraisal. They got somebody to do it but something happened medically and the person ended up in the hospital. It took my mortgage to the second month because we had to wait a number of weeks. It got to the very end of the loan time before I was able to actually get it. Other than that, AmeriSave's communication was great. If I had a question, I could call and I would get an answer really quickly.",4

Every time they asked for something, I gave it to them. My loan officer was fantastic. The emails and the calls were on point. I was kept informed about what was going on. Everything went pretty well.",5
Alexander,"Savannah, GA","Reviewed June 8, 2022","AmeriSave has a very fast and smooth process. Everything was good but there was one little thing. It was hard to reach the person who sent me all the requests. But after I call and then give them answers, they answer very fast. They answer all my questions.",4
Derrick,"Smyrna, TN","Reviewed June 8, 2022","My rep Elizabeth took a personal touch. Her willingness to have patience and how she thoroughly explained everything impressed me. I felt very comfortable working with her. I was totally satisfied with the whole process. But I got lowballed on the appraisal as it came $17,000 less than what Elizabeth and I thought it would be. There was no reason on paper objectively that my house should have been appraised lower than the other comparable houses that they used.",5
Aderlin,"Bethlehem, PA","Reviewed June 7, 2022","The process with AmeriSave took roughly 25 days. It was quick. The application was easy and the reps are good. The rate was a little high but it was because of the time of the year, so it was not bad. I’ll recommend friends and family to AmeriSave.",5
James,"Carrollton, GA","Reviewed June 7, 2022","The loan officer stayed with us the whole way through as we were selling our house and getting ready for this house. He was not just easy to work with, but if we had a question, he answered immediately. He tried to make sure that everything worked for us and not against us as long as it was according to standards. He told us everything about the rates and terms beforehand and he got us in certain areas of loans where it will work out better. AmeriSave is an easy company to work with. They're gonna work for you.",5
Vandria,"Orangeburg, SC","Reviewed June 7, 2022","The communication with the reps was very good especially with the loan originator, Joel. He contacted me constantly and went out of his way. He was so personable. I'm satisfied with them seeing how rates are going back up.",5
Albert,"Philadelphia, PA","Reviewed June 6, 2022","My loan originator from AmeriSave, Andrea, went above and beyond. There were a couple of glitches on the technical side when it came to uploading documents but she was patient and walked me through everything. She was outstanding. As far as my questions, if she didn't have the answer, she would find the answer and then get back to me promptly. Given the current circumstances of the way the rates are, I feel like I made it out very well. I especially appreciated the ability of AmeriSave to do a soft pull, so I knew what I was getting into before they did a full credit pull. I know not a lot of companies do that. I knew pretty much what I was getting into before I even signed up for anything or had my credit ran.",5
Efrain,"Springfield, MA","Reviewed June 6, 2022","The application was pretty smooth and easy. Also, the reps I worked with were quick and the loan officer was always available when I needed it. I would recommend them.",5
Bethany,"Michigan City, IN","Reviewed June 6, 2022","Their rep called us and talked to us about everything. We used the dashboard like he told us to keep on everything and we closed within a month. Communication was great. If we had any questions, we could reach out to him at any time. He'd get back to us in a very timely manner. We got a better rate. I'm very satisfied overall.",5
John,"Saugus, MA","Reviewed June 5, 2022","AmeriSave had the quickest response. I liked Gary, the person that I worked with, and the overall good experience. The online application process was simple and easy. Gary walked me right through it and it was done. AmeriSave is not a bad company to go with. They're straight to the point. Everything they said was exactly what it was. There was nothing hidden.",5
Keenan,"Grand Rapids, MI","Reviewed June 5, 2022","My agent, Angel, made obtaining my mortgage as seamless as possible. I was impressed by how attentive and how quick to respond he was and how he assuaged all my concerns.",5
Tyson,"Stevensville, MT","Reviewed June 5, 2022",Obtaining my mortgage with AmeriSave was super easy. The whole process took 15 days and it was good with the loan officer. He answered the phone whenever I call him. I'd recommend AmeriSave. They did the best for me.,5
Kehvyn,"East Stroudsburg, PA","Reviewed June 4, 2022","Amerisave has excellent service. Whenever I tried to get in contact with someone, I got someone to talk to and it was handled professionally. But we were unable to get the loan due to the credit not being a certain amount. I was also given mixed messages. One minute, my wife has enough credit, and the next minute, she doesn't so I just called it off.",4
Juanita,"Ponchatoula, LA","Reviewed June 4, 2022",It worked really well with AmeriSave. Everybody kept us well-informed on what was going on and the overall process was very smooth.,5
Detrick,"Benton, AR","Reviewed June 4, 2022","They were in tune with me and they kept me informed every time something changed. That was really helpful, like a guide because this is my first time ever doing something ling this. It was a real smooth process. The only thing I'm confused about is they told me my mortgage was due on June 1st. But then I made a payment and they said it wasn't due till September.",5
Brian,"Virginia Beach, VA","Reviewed June 3, 2022","My loan officer talked me through the process. It was fairly simple. My loan officer also checked in with me every week, making sure everything was fine. I liked the rates. It was competitive with other offers.",4
Andrew,"Aiken, SC","Reviewed June 3, 2022",Everybody was very helpful. We had a couple of delays on last-minute paperwork but they did a pretty good job.,5
Victor,"Mesquite, TX","Reviewed June 3, 2022","Going through AmeriSave was pretty fast and easy. It was just emails, calling, and letting me know what the next step was. The only thing I struggled with was the survey of the house. Also, I wanted the lowest rate possible and zero interest rate. But I agree with it. My loan rep was good and I didn't feel like a customer. I felt like I was a friend. Give AmeriSave a try.",5
Monnae,"Philadelphia, PA","Reviewed June 2, 2022","I enjoyed working with AmeriSave until I found out on the very last day that they messed up my paperwork. I was supposed to receive 5% seller’s assistance so now I'm suing the former owner. Other than that, they were very personable and they kept me informed on everything. If I called, they answered the phone. If I emailed them, they responded within 24 hours.",3
Christy,"Vicksburg, MS","Reviewed June 2, 2022","We felt confident in the information that AmeriSave was providing. They were quick to give us the numbers regarding the interest rate that we would be provided, payment amounts that it would go to, and just an overall sense that the representative knew what he was talking about. We started out talking with one guy and he was so nice. To finish out the process, it was another lady. The reps were both terrific throughout the whole process of the refinance. AmeriSave was wonderful. They answered all the questions that we had. By the end of our refinance process, we were comfortable with the decisions that we had made. We did the refinance to pay off some things that we wanted to pay off. Everything worked out perfectly. I would do AmeriSave again.",5
Linda,"Cameron Park, CA","Reviewed June 1, 2022",My rep was really easy to work with. I'd tell others to get in touch with him at AmeriSave.,5
Lazedrick,"Baton Rouge, LA","Reviewed June 1, 2022",I was looking for another company to refinance with. Jeff with AmeriSave gave me a call five minutes after I showed interest. He asked me what I was trying to do and why I wanted to refinance my home. He gave me every option that he could and explained the rates at the time. He helped me calculate the money I was trying to add to my house. My current rate was at a 4.7 and the one that he got me into was right around 3.1 so it just made sense entirely.,5
Shelley,"Thornton, CO","Reviewed May 31, 2022","I liked how my loan officer Christine explained everything. The process went pretty well. They had a couple of glitches in their system and it would kick back and ask me the same questions over and over but we got through it. They had very good customer service. As with any closing, it always gets really hairy but they did very well overall.",5
Maria,"Charlotte, NC","Reviewed May 31, 2022","I did a 30-year mortgage with AmeriSave. In the beginning, it was a little stressful not necessarily because of the personnel, but I was going through a separation, so I had to get documents from my ex. The process took two months. My rep was direct and she was able to answer all the questions asked. I was very comfortable with her. The rates were good based on my credit because I had gotten in some financial issues then. Overall, the process was smooth and the experince was great. I'm hoping that as my credit gets better, I probably can refinance a better rate. If that interest rate then would go up, I might just stick with what I have.",5
Zachary,"Irwin, PA","Reviewed May 30, 2022","The application and underwriting process was pretty straightforward. We were looking for a quick preapproval and Pamela got me set up right away. They weren't the lowest rate originally but they were able to lock it in and it worked out. They sent what I needed and we moved on from there. Pam and Chris would check, call, text, and email and walk me through everything.",4
Tamaron,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed May 30, 2022","Our situation is a little bit different from the majority of people so AmeriSave had to jump through some hoops with our land contract. But from the time of our application until we closed, they kept open communication and were really honest with us. They gave us a loan originator who was going on vacation for two weeks, right before our contract was up, which had me nervous. It was a little bit stressful having somebody that they knew was going to go on vacation right around the time that we were going to be down the wire. But her colleagues filled in. They returned calls within a couple of hours and it ended up working out. We refinanced faster than some of our friends that were doing the same process and they were already in a traditional mortgage. AmeriSave did their part in making it a speedy process for us.",5
Edward,"Coweta, OK","Reviewed May 29, 2022",I went with a 15-year fixed loan program with AmeriSave. I started the process online and there was a lot of documentation involved. I worked with Bo and I felt great working with him. He’s real thorough and easy to understand.,5
Ninfa,"Houston, TX","Reviewed May 29, 2022","I spoke with Jessica and she answered all my questions. She was always available. But the application and underwriting process took five months and it could have been faster. Also, the rates and terms weren’t as good as I wanted them to be.",4
Kate,"Elizabethtown, PA","Reviewed May 28, 2022","I wanted a little bit more information as the process went along. The appraisal also took way too long and the appraiser didn't live anywhere near where I lived. I didn't know why it would take three weeks. That was frustrating. I've done properties where I have to do what an appraisal is for companies for relocations. I don't get to have three weeks. You get 48 hours to turn it around and get it out. Plus, I've shelled out 620 for the appraisal so if it didn't go through, that's a significant chunk of money. They also sent me text messages from other people saying I still needed to do this or that. It was always somebody different and there was always a different phone number. I didn't understand that. They're probably working from home but it was a little weird.",4
Robert,"St. George, UT","Reviewed May 28, 2022","I had used AmeriSave previously to refinance our home. I reached out to them and ended up talking to one of the same agents that I worked with on my refinance. There was familiarity and they were fairly competitive on the rates and stuff. The process is always a little more than I would like but it was good. Whoever I was working with was available to explain things so it went pretty smooth. The only thing was when there was a task to be completed and I had uploaded or completed it, I got pinged by somebody I hadn't worked with. They reached out and reminded me to do something I had already done. There might be a lag in syncing of servers. But it wasn't a big deal because I knew I did it already.",5
Andrew,"Thompsons Station, TN","Reviewed May 28, 2022","They're my current lender and on the first go-around, they did a wonderful job. I decided to try again and stick with them because it's a lot easier whenever they have all my information. We got all the information and we did the process of the refi. It was simple and easy. Also, my new rate and terms are the best that you can get at the moment with the way the market is.",5
Robert,"Disputanta, VA","Reviewed May 27, 2022","AmeriSave had the best rates and could get it done the quickest so I went with them. They sent me a link and I got online and filled out the application. A lady by the name of Christine was very helpful, texting back and forth and calling. I would send her a text for any questions I had and within five minutes, she'd respond. Everything's been fine.",5
Milan,"Gilbert, AZ","Reviewed May 27, 2022","I could do all the preliminary things like pre-approval online before I applied. I could see where I was standing because I just filled in the numbers and their system would show me what was the range of the rate that I could qualify for. It was very transparent. It was not even two weeks and we were closing because they already had my information as this is my third time with them. All three times, I was dealing with Charles directly. He's very calming, responsive and reassuring. When I have additional questions, he would be able to respond right away. This is what I liked the most. Communication is very good with them. I also like that they are more realistic and conservative. They were a lot closer to the actual appraisal.",5
Sheila,"Bowie, MD","Reviewed May 27, 2022","The rep was very nice, clear and walked me through everything. I had my documents back to him in less than an hour, and we were done. That was the easiest thing I've ever done. The rate was extremely good and when my loan officer picked up, she was great. Mostly everything was done by email. There wasn't any haggling. It was not closed upon when it should have been only because I was out of town. When the guy came in, he knew his stuff. He was professional and went through everything. AmeriSave Mortgage was excellent. The first and second time I did my mortgage, I was so confused. I didn't know whether I made the worst mistake in my life. But with this, I was very clear. I knew what I was looking at. The documents that were there for me to review, I could go back over them again. There were a couple of questions I needed to ask my loan officer because my husband's salary ended up being higher than what I anticipated and he said it didn't make any difference.",5
Fenix,"Long Beach, CA","Reviewed May 26, 2022","If I could give my AmeriSave Loan Originator, Troy **, and Loan Processor, Kegan **, 10 STARS, I would! Overall, an uber pleasant experience working with both loan professionals.

M.,"Ma, MA","Reviewed May 26, 2022","The application process with AmeriSave Mortgage was good until they started getting into the nitty-gritty and digging for all the other information. A few years back, I filed a bankruptcy with my business and they were saying that there were documents out there that had my wife's name on it that were part of the foreclosure, and it wasn't. It was a timeshare. I had to try to locate all my documents for the timeshare I got rid of to prove that she wasn't on them. That was kind of a pain in the butt. But getting the W-2s, scanning them and submitting them was easy. My rep, Laura, was good. She was on and off the phone quite a bit. If we called her and left her a voicemail, she'd get back to us.

Anissa,"Lincolnton, NC","Reviewed May 25, 2022","Communication was a little slow at first, but this was right after COVID, so I didn't expect more. The only thing I don't like is there's no way to get out of the PMI mortgage, and nobody wants to help you with that. We've tried to talk to AmeriSave about that because we have so much equity in our home, but they won't let us get out of the PMI.",4
Christe,"Hoover, AL","Reviewed May 25, 2022",The refinance part was way easier than the initial process. They were pleased with how fast they got the documents. They said I was the easiest customer they had and I said they were the easiest client that I had. The rate is really good seeing as the economy is going to crap.,5
Jernie,"Pontiac, IL","Reviewed May 25, 2022","Jana, the loan officer, made me feel more comfortable ‘cause I had no idea what I was doing. She explained the mortgage to me very well. She was very personable and she answered all my questions. The process was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I got a rate locked in a lot lower before it started rising.",5
Richard And Mrs.,"Leesburg, FL","Reviewed May 22, 2022","The process was very informative. The answers were always there if we had questions and we liked working with AmeriSave. They were very efficient. We worked with Mike and he was so helpful by asking the right questions, and helping us find what would be best for us. He was very good. Any time we contacted him, he got right back to us and answered our questions. Then a very nice lady came to our house with all the paperwork and she was a notary. There were probably 100 pieces of paper that we went through with her. We signed things and it went all very smoothly. It was a very good experience. We went down several points and we're very pleased with it so far.",5
Debbie,"Middletown, OH","Reviewed May 21, 2022","They are a good company. They followed through on everything they said they would do and they were timely and professional. Andrea Joy, the rep I worked with, was very personable. She answered the phone every time I called and if not, she called me back within minutes. They covered all the bases and made it as easy for me as possible to get what I needed to get done in a timely fashion. They beat competitors on the rates. I was more than pleased.",5
Allisson,"Lexington, SC","Reviewed May 20, 2022","They were very helpful and they told me what I needed to do. I love that. I came back to them because of their service.

I started at the end of February and I was done by the end of March.",5

Hunter,"Chatsworth, GA","Reviewed May 18, 2022","My experience with them was pretty smooth. The people we had working with us were straightforward. Overall, it was stress-free process. It took us a little longer because we had so many houses that went so fast. But once we got locked in on the house, it took us just about a month. My rep was very helpful and he answered any questions that we had. I could reach out to him any time of day and he would reach back out. We really appreciated that. We definitely recommend AmeriSave.",5
Stacey,"Clairton, PA","Reviewed May 17, 2022","The rep was phenomenal, and the application process was easy. It took six weeks, but most of the delays were mine, getting information that I needed. I have no complaints whatsoever. The rate was the best, the follow-up and the speed in which it all closed were great, and the ease of being able to do everything on a portal was good. I would tell people to go and use AmeriSave.",5

Daniel,"Spotsylvania, VA","Reviewed May 16, 2022","AmeriSave Mortgage was the first people who gave me a call back. My friend told me about them and going online. So, I went online and started filling the information. Everything was easy and made sense. AmeriSave was very easy to work with. They said, “This is what we need from you guys. This is what we can do. I need this form.” The only thing that held us up in any way was just the VA part. The biggest thing was trying to get all information over in a timely manner. And I went through two agents before I finished with the last guy. So, that took a bit of time. Because I was like, “Hey, where we at?” And I didn’t get anything so I called. And they said, “Oh, that person is actually no longer here now.” So, AmeriSave had a turnaround with agents there. But the gentleman was very informative.",5
Jennifer,"Cedar Grove, NC","Reviewed May 15, 2022","We had a builder loan and we were transferring over into regular conventional financing. I filled out an application online and followed the instructions. Somebody called me and we just completed everything through email. It took a while but it wasn't AmeriSave's fault. It was a problem with us. We built our own house and there were some things that had to get finished up that we were not aware of. Other than that, they're as easy to deal with as anybody else.",5
James,"Warner Robins, GA","Reviewed May 14, 2022","I worked with several people and the experience was good. AmeriSave got me the rate I wanted with the conditions I wanted. The closing costs were reasonable too. There was a bit of a snag ‘cause I had a home equity line of credit. From the beginning, I told them if it was going to be a problem, to let me know. They told me it wasn't, but it ended up getting delayed about six months because of problems due to the home equity line of credit. All of a sudden, my closing costs ended up tripling because the rate went up. But ultimately, they stood on their word and ended up giving me my original numbers so everything worked out at the end.",4
Manoj,"Rolling Meadows, IL","Reviewed May 13, 2022","I was shopping around for the rates and, among three of those, AmeriSave Mortgage had the better rates. Also, they were responsive. I started online, and then they connected with me. They got some information about me, and everything was on their portal. So, it was all online later on. They can improve the transition from somebody who started my process into the lending officer. But even if the portal was not updated or if they had some transition of information, then transition from one person to another, the rep did a lot of follow-ups and they wanted the things to move faster. So, that was good. Moreover, what was impressive about them were the debt consolidation options that they provided and they helped me out in paying off some of my credit cards.",5
Robert,"Covington, LA","Reviewed May 12, 2022",The process overall was very easy. The guy that we worked with was really helpful throughout the entire process and was really easy to work with.

The appraisal company was horrible and the appraisal guy went MIA for a while. ",3

After that, the title company saw that appraisal two days before the closing date. But there was some other additional information in the address. And they said they wanted to add a new address.

Eric,"Milford, OH","Reviewed May 9, 2022",I would recommend Amerisave. Everybody I worked with was top-notch. My very first phone call had the information I needed and it kind of gave me a positive feeling the whole time. The application itself wasn't very long and the underwriting process was quick. I talked to Sean and he gave me a good indication that I would be approved from the very get-go. It motivated me to get it done quickly. ,5
Woodrow,"Culpeper, VA","Reviewed May 9, 2022","AmeriSave's rate was lowest one we got. The time frame was good. We were always kept in a loop. Everything was handled well and quickly.

Diane,"Lewes, DE","Reviewed May 8, 2022","I liked the person I was working with very much. They were excellent. But the process was lengthy and a pain in the butt.

Dale,"Milwaukie, OR","Reviewed May 8, 2022","The company I work for says that our customers buy from us because of the name on the wall. And the sales guys are said, “No, you're sure wrong.” I agree. The reason that I'm glad that I went with AmeriSave had nothing to do with the name of the company as much as just the individual that I worked with. People buy from people. People buy because of the people they deal with and how they're treated, not just the name on the wall.",5
Timothy,"Winchester, VA","Reviewed May 7, 2022","I had considered AmeriSave a couple of years ago and it came back to a private road issue, which I have since resolved. I looked around to a couple different mortgage companies and AmeriSave had better incentives on the loan, which worked for us. I liked the fact that they helped fill the application out because it is a pain sometimes. I work 12 hours a day and out of town so there were a couple of frustrating points where they needed something and I couldn't get to it until I got home that evening. But that was not a big deal. They were trying to go through the loan as quick as possible. I've done this probably about half a dozen or more times before, and I've never closed within 10 days. The loan administrator did a good job with it. I told him what my problem was. He came back with a solution and it worked out really well. I got a good rate, which I was happy about. ",5
Tapchom,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed May 7, 2022","AmeriSave Mortgage locked me in right away by pushing me to pay for the appraisal. They worked on a Sunday. So, they make your process easy. I could have done better on the rate because after all, I got another mortgage company that called me and got me something better. But I couldn't do it because I just locked that process. From the beginning, the rep was on top of it. He let me know what I need to put as paper, check on his side, and he kept contacting me. It was great customer service, back and forth.",5
Fayellen,"Portland, OR","Reviewed May 6, 2022","We had been in a horrible communication with another lender. Then, I contacted AmeriSave and in less than four weeks, we were done and dusted.

She got back to me with any answers to questions in a matter of hours. She took me through, step by step, about things that I might need to do or might find challenging. I was very pleased.",5

Eileen,"Southport, NC","Reviewed May 4, 2022","This was the easiest and quickest refinance we have ever done. I compared the rate and how AmeriSave Mortgage would be able to close a refinance, and they said less than 30 days. That was something that we hadn't experienced. It had always been close to the seven weeks. So, it was quick and they were very good about letting us know exactly what we needed to do and have, and sending things. Everything was online, as far as the documents, back and forth, and e-signing. That made it easy as well. We had a person come to the house that we did all the final closing at home, which was another convenience. The quickness of it also, because the rates would go up, so they wanted to make sure that we were locked in at the lowest rate possible before the interest rate was raised. Frank was very quick to get back to me when I emailed him and to return phone calls.",5
Bennett,"Yakima, WA","Reviewed May 4, 2022",Working with AmeriSave was perfect all the way from start to finish. Brandon was the first person I talked to when I responded to their email. It's always a more challenging situation when dealing with small business owners like me and he was very upfront about what he could do for me and what he could help out. He explained how he had worked with lots of small business owners in the past and had really good luck. We did a lot of the process over the phone so I didn't have to do too much paperwork and it was mainly electronic signatures and things like that. It all worked really well and everything was really clear. I was very happy with the rates and terms and I got to lock in with the low rates.,5
John,"Lewes, DE","Reviewed May 3, 2022","Tim did a phenomenal job. He always answered the phone and responded to email. He was very courteous and very clear on what AmeriSave Mortgage needed. I had first calls service with him. AmeriSave's rate was a quarter percent higher, but I still went with them. They should be a bit more competitive with the rate process.

But I also worked with Angela and if I had gone with just based on her, I would have never used AmeriSave. Her customer service and her response time were horrible. She rarely answered her phone and when I couldn’t reach her, I would call Clayton. Also, the rates and terms could have been better but considering the circumstances, it worked out well.",4
Jon,"Bloomington, IN","Reviewed May 2, 2022","A few years ago, when I refinanced with AmeriSave Mortgage, it seemed to be a lot more hectic. And I didn't look forward to doing it because it was a pain with the paperwork that they wanted. And they would want it again, and again. It seemed like it was a real fiasco. But this time, everything went smoothly. I sent things over, and they accepted them. I was impressed with how quick it went. I would give the rep an A all the way across.",5
Sheila,"Wasilla, AK","Reviewed May 2, 2022","Everybody was really friendly and they got back to me immediately. They walked me through every step of the way. The people I dealt with were awesome. The mortgage process was pretty simple but drawn out towards the end with me having to repeatedly send in the same thing. The closing took longer than expected due to them wanting more documentation. It was really frustrating. Also, I don't like my new rate. After the first six years, the rate stays the same, and then it fluctuates. I'll probably sell my house by then or refinance again so I'm not stuck with a fluctuating rate.",4
Simon Peter,"Gaithersburg, MD","Reviewed May 1, 2022","AmeriSave has been very patient with me. They have the best banker. His name is Zachary. He has been working with me for almost one full year. There are a lot of issues that keep on going because sometimes, the first mortgage company called SPSS didn't want to spend the copay out. There's this information from PNC where they have to get me involved. They don't want to disclose information. ",5
Adrian,"Moreno Valley, CA","Reviewed May 1, 2022","Customer service is what I liked about them. The rep I spoke to was very helpful and easygoing. She was very detailed in explaining the whole process. Any questions I had, I called her and she was readily available to answer. She would call me back. I was impressed most by her openness and her willingness to help me up until the closing where she was able to save me money. She adjusted the interest. So, she was looking out for me.  The only hard part was to get the documents. But uploading them was simple.",5
Beverly,"Jacksonville, AL","Reviewed April 30, 2022","AmeriSave had a user-friendly application process. The rep we worked with was very helpful. He called us and checked on things quite often. I liked him. The rate we got wasn't quite as low as I was hoping to get, but it was a 4.1, so it was a lot lower than what we had, which was 6.125. Since we weren't borrowing that much money, our rep said the less that you borrow, the rates get higher and the more you borrow, the rates are lower. The only thing is my husband had asked if there was a local agent that we could go to, and there wasn’t. We're old school people so we like to face-to-face with somebody and discuss things and tell us how to do it and how to go about it. Everything was over the internet. It’s a little more difficult for senior adults, but we figured it out and got through it. AmeriSave has a nice group of people. I think we'll be happy with them. They treated us well.",5
Niaz,"Lodi, CA","Reviewed April 30, 2022","AmeriSave is a good company. They help people. I got a good person and anytime I needed help and I called and emailed, he gave me an answer right away. The application process was very fast. They gave me a good interest rate.",5
Eric,"Rock Hill, SC","Reviewed April 29, 2022","The process with AmeriSave took about a month, but it was very simple. I'm glad that I got in the last week before the rates went up. The only thing is it took us a while to figure out how to pay online. At first, I couldn't pay online. There were a few different sketchy websites. I just typed in, ""AmeriSave pay online."" We signed up for automatic withdrawals, assuming that they would see our checking account there and they would withdraw themselves. They didn't. But I guess that was my wife's fault for not sending a check. So, the payment process was a little bit sketchy and a little bit hard, but we got it figured out.",5
Beatris,"New Carrollton, MD","Reviewed April 29, 2022","We were happy that AmeriSave called. We let them know the issues we were having with previous lenders. The rep Cory said, “Well, let me speak to my manager. And we'll see what we can do.” They helped us out and it was great. Everything moved somewhat fast. If we needed something and it was a weekend, the rep was okay with taking a phone call and answering questions. There was a time where he got sick and he was still answering our emails. That really helped a lot. It was good customer service.",5
James,"Westbrook, ME","Reviewed April 28, 2022","I dealt with Cynthia who worked on my last refi with AmeriSave. She was awesome. She would get back to me. If I left her a message, she'd get back to me the same day, sometimes the same hour. Then if I called and she was on the line, she'd send me a text saying she'd call me right back. She always did. I was very happy. I went up half a point from where I was on my previous loan, and she put it on a 15-year term for me, which I'm gonna pay off in six and a half years. I would recommend AmeriSave to anybody. Customer service was unbeatable. It was a good experience. Cynthia was right on top of her game. She knew what she was talking about.",5
Randi,"Sand Springs, OK","Reviewed April 28, 2022","The online application process was good and uploading the required documents and getting the required information over to them was easy. Also, the rep I worked with was very customer service friendly and I got a better interest rate.",5
Ryan,"Kalamazoo, MI","Reviewed April 27, 2022","Initially, I went through a lot of loan officers. Within the first two months, I had gone through four, which I thought was a little unusual for a mortgage company. It seemed like every other week, I got someone new and they wouldn't tell me why besides that they were assigned to me. But once we put the offer in with the house, it was a very quick and smooth process. The very last rep I worked with, Christine, was amazing. I like her prompt responses. There wasn't a time where I questioned if she knew what she was doing. She was very respectful and professional. She would almost be answering emails on the weekend it seemed. It was very nice to have someone there. However, when I locked in my interest rate, I was not aware that I would have to pay more to keep that low interest rate. Amerisave could inform their consumers more about something they're gonna have to pay for instead of trying to find out at the very end.",4
Nadine,"Westampton, NJ","Reviewed April 27, 2022","My rep with AmeriSave was fine and responsive. I worked with Muhammad and he explained everything. The process was long but it was to be expected. The website thing was helpful but sometimes it could be clearer, like in terms of what to do. It has a very comprehensive list of stuff sometimes and you don't need to upload all of that. If they could optimize the website, it would be good.",4
James,"New Braunfels, TX","Reviewed April 26, 2022","The process started out good then it bogged down big time. The gentleman I was working on it left and nobody was able to notice that I wasn't being served. I finally got ahold of someone named Robert, which was not easy, and he jumped on it and took real good care of me. He worked hard and stayed in contact with me to try to get everything done. He and a couple of the other guys had helped me get going. I was pleased with the overall process and everything that they did.",4
Meagan,"Dartmouth, MA","Reviewed April 25, 2022","Amerisave has been great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The loan originator we had walked us through everything. He was very helpful the entire process. Everything was done smoothly. It was so organized that we closed early. This was our first time purchasing a home, and it was way better than we expected. He understood that this was our first time purchasing a home so throughout the whole process, he explained what was happening, what to expect in the coming weeks, and even things that were more related to the real estate side. Our agent was also new so she wasn't helpful a lot of the time.",5
Walter,"Carlisle, OH","Reviewed April 24, 2022","It was wonderful with Amerisave. The young lady that helped me was the best customer service of the three. She went out of her way to communicate even when there was what appeared to be a glitch or if I had any further questions. She did a marvelous job. There were too many pages and needs but it went well. Their fees were higher than most but because she made the process seamless, I saved with it anyway.",5
Demetrio,"Smyrna, DE","Reviewed April 23, 2022","The experience with Amerisave was very professional. They informed me of everything every step of the way. They were very thorough. They wanted to make sure that I got the documentation right and that everything that I needed was in place and was ready to go for closing day. David gave me a heads up that there were gonna be other people calling me from Amerisave for information and to make sure these are the people I talk to. If somebody would keep trying to sell me more stuff with AmeriSave, to tell them to refer to him to get it straightened out.",5
Patricia,"Helena, MT","Reviewed April 23, 2022","My rep Curtis made time for me, held my hand through the process and gave me updates. My loan got transferred to more of a senior loan office and I wasn't getting the best response from him. Curtis ended up closing it out. The terms I received were fair though they weren't the lowest.",5
Vincent,"Jamestown, TN","Reviewed April 22, 2022","The loan officer was a good guy. There was some other guy processing the paperwork and he was not what I would consider user-friendly. But AmeriSave was a pretty good group to work with. It was a lot of going back and forth which was a little strange. They don't just give a list and say, ""Hey, we need all of this."" The gentleman I spoke with kept sending emails after the fact saying, ""Oh, now my people want this. Well, now they're asking for this. Well, now they want this."" Other than that, everything was pretty straightforward. The rate I got was higher than anticipated but it still cut the payment in half.",4
C.,"Ne, NE","Reviewed April 22, 2022","The representatives I worked with were very knowledgeable. Everyone was very polite and concerned that we go through the process and get everything done. But the application process was a joke. I put in the application and got all the paperwork. Then there was something that I wasn't doing quite right. I was looking at the wrong year that they were asking me information for. It would have been a simple thing for the person to have reached out and said what they wanted. Then when we had to switch from an FHA to conventional, I ended up having to put all of my documentation back in. That made me very unhappy.",4
Tigist,"Alexandria, VA","Reviewed April 21, 2022","As soon as you close the whole process, if you have any questions on if there's any remaining thing, getting their reps is very difficult. Some of them hung up on you, they keep transferring you, and they transfer you to the place where you don't even get service or where no one is there. They don't pick up. It's just on and on. Last time, I was sitting for more than half of the day just to process one thing to get one piece of information. Also, to make the program better, communication has to be easy, like email updates. Last time, there was an increase in my mortgage and I didn't get any notification. Other than that, the application process is perfect. I had good and competent people.",5
Kevin,"Lawrenceville, GA","Reviewed April 21, 2022","It was a very smooth process with Amerisave. It was also faster than I expected. They worked around my work schedule. My rep, Patrick, was awesome. Before the competitor responded, Patrick came back with even a better rate and better terms. He was very aggressive from the start and I appreciate that because at the end of the day, it's all about that bottom number. I sat and thought about it over the weekend but within a couple of hours he had won my business. ",5
Raymond,"Lakewood, OH","Reviewed April 20, 2022",Chris was upfront and explained the steps through the process. Everything that he explained was gonna happen happened. The process took a little longer but it was more on my end and we talked throughout everything.,5
Natane,"Middletown, VA","Reviewed April 20, 2022","Out of everybody, Kevin was more welcoming and a little bit more honest. He wasn’t very pushy. He just gave me the information and allowed me to make my decisions. Most of my friends haven’t refinanced yet and I told them to go with Amerisave.",5
Stephanie,"Toledo, OH","Reviewed April 19, 2022",Bradley ** was outstanding. He always stayed in communication with me throughout the loan processes and kept me updated on what information I needed to turn-in and why. When I didn't understand information he took the time to explain why it was needed. There was times when I felt discouraged because of the process and not understanding the depths of the home loans. Bradley was so patient's and understanding with me that he kept me going and excited to know that we were that much closer to the American dream. I feel truly bless to have worked with Bradley and will be referring him to family and friends.,5
James,"Loxahatchee, FL","Reviewed April 19, 2022","The information on the different loans available was the best of all banks I contacted. However, once the initial sale was made and you deposited the $500 to lock the offer the communication with the loan consultant stopped. Many mistakes were made in the process, and it was difficult to correct the mistakes made by the company in the documentation.",2
Brenda,"Marietta, GA","Reviewed April 19, 2022","The lender contacted me within a day and the processor sent me an email and all the required information. He was wonderful. If I had any questions, he was the one I typically reached out to. Any hiccups, he was quick to respond to me. If he couldn’t answer, he would send me an email or text, let me know that he was on another call, and he’d return my call shortly. I had my own portal and I uploaded all the information or whatever I was missing. The process was seamless. There was one hiccup, but that was something else they needed at the last moment through no fault of anyone’s. The refinance closed fairly easy. The rate was a little high, but it was good.",5
Justin,"Spring Hill, TN","Reviewed April 19, 2022","When I checked on different places, I found Amerisave to be the easiest to work with, with the most clear process. They were responding in a timely manner. Their rates were as good or better than all that I had called so, I was happy with that.",5
Daniel,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed April 18, 2022","I like the professionalism on the person I got on the other side of the phone. The other company was Rocket Mortgage, and the guy was very aggressive and very unprofessional. The experience with AmeriSave was great. The process went quick. Most of the loans take time. I've heard them go 45 days in some instances. We started on January 30th and we signed closing on February 23rd. The lady that assisted us was real good. The only thing that took a little bit of time with the inspector was he was supposed to have the report back to them within a certain amount of days, but he didn't. That kind of upset me, but they got it squared away.",5
Daniel,"Decatur, AL","Reviewed April 18, 2022","Part of the reason that I used Amerisave was that when you go to the site and you put your info in, and it kind of gives you a preapproval, a quick check. The information was accurate. I worked with Amanda who was knowledgeable and easy to work with. Any questions that I had, she was able to help and willing to help. I had talked to other companies, and that was not always the case. Some of them just wanted to push whatever it was that they were trying to sell or not even do that without doing a credit check right there on the spot. We got a good deal with Amerisave and we're happy. Having gone through it, if I ever have the need in the future, I would definitely reach back out to them.",5

He walked me through the thing, which I kind of needed a little bit as far as transferring the documents and downloading things. They closed quickly, which was what I was after. I went with a 20-year note, which gave me a little better closing cost.",5

It was high-quality communication. There were lots of phone calls. Overall, there were some things that were very good and some things that were at times exasperating. All of the stuff with the loan processor was excellent. What was somewhat exasperating was the endless parade of documents that were bordering on the silly. Part of it was that it was a complicated situation because of probate. It was refinancing a HELOC that was actually in the name of someone who is dead.",4

Florante,"Palm Desert, CA","Reviewed April 11, 2022","My experience with AmeriSave was quite pleasant. They were very straightforward. They tell you what it is, how much the rate is, and how much is your ending APR based on points or lack of points, and then what's your monthly and what is your next billing once you get approved. They also gave me a timeline as to when would it possibly close. AmeriSave had the lowest and the shortest closing time, and then the process with them was so clear. So when I refinance, I recommend to my friends and to myself to always check with AmeriSave first. But I always double-check their figures before I move on.",5

Frances,"Houston, DE","Reviewed April 10, 2022","I called AmeriSave because they had a good review.

One guy come out to do the appraisal and was like, ""Okay, I'm here from Flagship Appraisals."" They were right up here in Smyrna and not far from me, and he didn't have an ID badge or any identity on the shirt or jacket. He went through the house and said nothing all the way through.

So, I called again and the rep set me up with a senior loan officer, Timothy and he really helped me out on getting me a good deal for the what would be now current primary home.

It's stressful when you go through those things because just when you think you've done everything, they come up with something else you need. But it was all stuff that I could produce. It was in less than a month that it was closed.",5
Richard,"Chesapeake Beach, MD","Reviewed March 28, 2022",The refinance with AmeriSave went as expected. It didn’t take long at all. I'm happy with them.,5
Fernando,"Antioch, TN","Reviewed March 28, 2022","Everything was great from the beginning through the end. They were always in contact. If you have a question, you just call them and they help you. I got 2.9 rate and that is exactly what I need. I don't have to refinance later on because the rate is real good. I will refer anybody that I know who's looking for a loan to AmeriSave because it's the best way to say thank you.",5
Wanda,"Calhoun, KY","Reviewed March 27, 2022","My husband and I never did FHA when we bought homes and AmeriSave wanted to do FHA. I didn’t argue with them. AmeriSave kept talking about the appraisal. I said that nobody had been here to do an appraisal yet and I didn't know what was going on. They said that they were gonna send somebody else out. They set up one date. I waited for the man all day but he did not show up. Finally, this man called me and said that AmeriSave called him and wanted him to come out and do my appraisal. But he doesn’t do those FHA appraisals. I asked when we were going to have the closing and AmeriSave said that they were waiting on the appraisal. I asked who was gonna appraise it and they said they called a man. I said that the guy was not going to do it because he doesn't do FHAs anymore. He only does banks. ",5

Nichole,"Irwin, PA","Reviewed March 27, 2022","I was very pleased with AmeriSave. The rep was nice and the application was easy but resubmitting the same paperwork over and over again was the most frustrating thing ever. They just kept saying they needed it and it felt like the same duplicate over and over. That's why the process took too long. Even my parents were getting frustrated and threatening to take away their gifts because they kept asking for too detailed statements and things that I read on the FHA thing that they didn't really even need. And then, they wouldn't accept my friend's gift, even though the FHA says they accept the close friends' gift.",3
Maria,"Bowdon, GA","Reviewed March 26, 2022","Working with AmeriSave was great and they had a better rate than the others. Everything went well.

Faron,"Honolulu, HI","Reviewed March 26, 2022","I had done business with AmeriSave previously and had a good experience. I'm a repeat customer. It made the process easier because they already had a lot of my stuff on file. They had a good rate. I'm dealing with them on a third thing now. I'm on a pre-approval, and I was able to get the same rep as last time, which was really good. Even though it was random, it ended up being the same guy. We had a very good relationship. Based on where everything's going, I'm very happy. All their promises upfront all materialized in the end.",5

Jeannine,"Duluth, MN","Reviewed March 24, 2022",Warning! This is a scam! They have you pay $500 to “secure your interest rate” but you don’t get the loan when you need it.

Lisa,"Palm Coast, FL","Reviewed March 23, 2022",The loan officer that I liked was Heather. She was very good. But the only thing that was a drawback was the phone tag. They would send multiple emails. It wouldn't be all in one shot. It was like too many hands were in the pot and trying to get it done was impossible. But we got it done.,5
Shawnte,"Old Hickory, TN","Reviewed March 22, 2022","Extremely inconsistent! I submitted for a pre-approval on 3/19/2022. In the chat, the rep requested to call my phone, but I let him know that I was working, so we set an appointment for 3/21/2022 at 4:30 pm. He then calls my phone anyway, so I had to briefly remind him of our appointment set for Monday and that I was still at work. He had the worst attitude with me! ",1

Glen,"Winnemucca, NV","Reviewed March 22, 2022","The process took about a month. But everything was fine. The representatives were great. They explained everything really well. It saved me. Everything worked out the way I wanted it to work out. Lowered my interest rates, saved me a little bit of money. So, it was a win-win for everybody. I was also glad to get in when I did. They were already talking about raising it. AmeriSave was great to work with. I would recommend to price them out and see what they’re offering amongst others.",5
Matthew,"Hagerstown, MD","Reviewed March 21, 2022","They call me daily from a call center in India from VOIP numbers that constantly change. The numbers do not have caller ID and use a local area code in an attempt to trick people into picking up. They also never leave a voicemail, further trying to lure people into answering. This type of marketing reflects poorly and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I wish these companies had an SOP limiting the number of harassing calls and to use a proper business phone number - it is disruptive to my day.",1
Shane,"Colorado Springs, CO","Reviewed March 21, 2022",We've used Amerisave before and it was way quicker to go with them again than starting over with someone else. Most of the communication was by email and text. That was perfect. They were great with us.,5

Ryan,"New Braunfels, TX","Reviewed March 20, 2022","The process was fairly simple. Zachary was my agent and he explained it to me. I was hesitant at first but he told me it would only take about 30, 45 minutes and costs $500. He hooked me up with the website where you can upload all your documents and it told me what I needed to do moving forward, so it was easy. However, when I was trying to make my first payment, I had called AmeriSave a lot trying to figure out who to pay. They kept trying to get me to the sales department. But nobody would ever answer, so I left a couple messages. I was freaking out, thinking that I was gonna have a late payment on my first payment. But they said they had received it a couple days before that, so it was all good.",5
Sharon,"High Point, NC","Reviewed March 20, 2022","I talked to Matt from AmeriSave. He was fabulous. He walked me through everything, step by step. He was very helpful and kept in touch. It went incredibly smooth and I wasn't expecting that. It was a great experience. The rate was good. It was better than what I had with Freedom. The payment is higher than I would like it. But Matt gave me three options, and one of those options was to pay off all my bills and that was what I went with. I felt like the documents were a lot though. But it was stuff that I had on hand, so it wasn’t terrible. My first payment is due April 1st, so I was trying to set it up online. But I didn't get that link. But whenever I called the 800 number on there, the rep walked me through the steps. It was very simple. He was so helpful. All the way around, I’ve been very pleased.",5
Victoria,"Williamsburg, VA","Reviewed March 19, 2022","Everything was fantastic with AmeriSave's process with the exception of the notary that they sent over. They FedExed the loan docs to AmeriSave and they lost them. So, I had to go back and re-sign all the paperwork, which then put me in panic mode because all of my information is somewhere out there. I had to do a whole bunch. I had to stop all the credit bureaus. I had to take the overdraft off my checking account. So, that was a little disconcerting and I don't think they found it yet. But that had nothing to do with AmeriSave. It was FedEx. Everything else was great. AmeriSave's reps were fantastic.",5
Brandon,"Fuquay Varina, NC","Reviewed March 19, 2022","The application process was quick and easy.

They came right in and tried and did. Overall, it was a great experience.",5
Neil,"Boynton Beach, FL","Reviewed March 18, 2022",I don't like AmeriSave’s online process because my wife and I are dinosaurs. We hate the computer and use it for email so I’d rather talk to a person. But it was a wonderful experience with the rep that I worked with.,5
Douglas,"Leesburg, VA","Reviewed March 18, 2022","I've worked with AmeriSave before in the past and that was why I reached out to have them do both of my refis. I've always carried high regard and remarks for this team. AmeriSave is my go-to. Peter, my rep, is great and friendly. We seemed to touch base on lots of different side matters that were relative but also investigative. He was able to have the knowledge and ability to know what was coming up next. He would question me about certain things and I’d question him about certain things. So, he is very skilled. He went the extra mile, too. Sometime through the process, you'll have a processor, but there'll be times that Peter would still intercept and help out, saying, “I know Cindy is your processor, but make sure you did this,"" or, ""You had a question about that. I can try to field your questions.”",4

Juan,"Greensboro, NC","Reviewed March 16, 2022",The refinance with AmeriSave is a blur now due to so many things but it seemed fast to me. It was seamless. The guy walked me through a lot of it and it was a pleasant experience. The terms were a lot lower than what I was dealing with before.,5
C.,"Nc, NC","Reviewed March 16, 2022",It was a good experience with AmeriSave. The lady that was taking our information was very professional. She had a lot of patience. The appraiser was professional and quick. The process took a while though because I had to look for most of our information.,5
Nancy,"Mount Vernon, OH","Reviewed March 15, 2022","Anderson was the gentleman I talked to first at AmeriSave and he was really helpful and knowledgeable. I'd gone through everything with him and I trusted him. With Anderson, it was phenomenal. In the middle of our getting together all our closing paperwork, we had a girl named Sarah and she was great. Then she left the company and we got a different girl. After that point, it wasn't so great. It was really drawn out. There wasn't a lot of communication. It had gotten down almost the wire of what we were gonna sign for our house, and we still didn't even know if they had everything they needed. ",4
Charlie,"Paragould, AR","Reviewed March 15, 2022",I reached out to Amerisave and was quickly connected with my guy. He stayed with me and was able to get me taken care of. He was very responsive and quick on his replies. He got me the information I needed and made the process very painless and seamless. I was well pleased with the service. I'm a sucker for convenience and Amerisave definitely won there. I work in sales and customer service myself so it's real important to me to get good customer experience.,5
Jacque,"Kansas City, MO","Reviewed March 14, 2022","The individual that called me from AmeriSave was very direct, got paperwork through very efficiently, responded to my emails quickly, and sent me a text message so I knew they were there to go look for them. It was a painless process on my side, and that was what I needed. Our house was paid for, but I took a home equity line that I had and wasn't borrowing the full value of the house. We were borrowing 100,000. I wanted to do some outside rework and foundation work was needed to be done on the house. It wasn't anything critical to harm the house, but I still needed to spend the money. He got the process through and did all the paperwork without me having to follow up. He followed up quickly and effortlessly on my part. Anything I asked him, he responded to it immediately and took care of it. The whole thing took like three weeks from start to finish. I signed the papers and had the money in the bank.",5
Brittany,"Batesville, MS","Reviewed March 14, 2022",Joseph with Amerisave was very helpful. He explained everything to us. Everything went good. I was a little scared at first because I've never done an online mortgage process but they made me feel very good about it.,5

We were getting lost in the forms. The loan officer said he'd take care of it and he did. He walked in right through, gave me extraordinary care. My family used to be in mortgages and real estate, and we've had nightmares. We didn't have anything like that with the AmeriSave Mortgage. We also closed in two weeks. I've never done that. I was so amazed that it closed that quickly.",5

Sandy,"Charlotte, NC","Reviewed March 12, 2022","AmeriSave was available to answer questions right away when I needed them to instead of somebody having to call me back. The rate was a little disappointing but I don't think that that was because of AmeriSave. That was because of our personal credit history. We didn't quite save on the rate as much as we thought but we also did an equity line, so that helps, too. AmeriSave did a good job for us.",5
Barbara,"Langhorne, PA","Reviewed March 12, 2022",Amerisave was very informative and the process was wonderful. I liked the man that I talked to. He was excellent.

Taylor,"Canton, OK","Reviewed March 11, 2022","It was great with Amerisave. The process took a little bit longer than what they told me was typical and it had to do with the Oklahoma City Abstract & Title Co, but as far as the way I understand, it wasn't on Amerisave.

There's another guy who's in charge of my account now for this pre-approval. But I've been calling him Friday, Saturday, Monday, and today, and he still hasn't responded back to me. I reached out to his supervisor and called Austin. Austin always picked up and said he was gonna let them know but nobody ever called me back.",5
Keith,"Charlotte, NC","Reviewed March 10, 2022","I would recommend Amerisave. The process was perfect. Within a matter of a couple of weeks, they were able to do everything. Once I got the appraisal in, they expedited it very quickly. I've done this before with other companies and it took forever. The communication with Amerisave was also excellent. There was a lady named Camille and a gentleman who it was assigned to. They both kept with me and let me know what was going on the entire time.",5
Ileana,"Katy, TX","Reviewed March 9, 2022","I was doing a refinance first with Chase and they didn't do anything. I started looking around and I found AmeriSave and tried it and it was worth it. They asked me for the Chase bank statements from three months, and they also asked me for my retirement pay stuff because I retired last year. I had emails all the time updating the information. I talked to people on the phone too. Taking into consideration my credit, the rate and terms were okay with me.  ",4
M.,"Pa, PA","Reviewed March 9, 2022","The person who called me was personable and gave me a very good rate. The timeframe was in line with my expectations. In the end, there was a little bit of back and forth to get my final funding in my bank account. That took a little longer than what I had expected. I should have got the buyer in my bank on that day when we closed or the following day. Whether they give me a check or wire the funding, that should happen the following day. But it took two or three days and I had to follow up on that. Otherwise, the whole process until the close was very smooth and I was very comfortable working with Amerisave.",5
David,"Rio Rancho, NM","Reviewed March 8, 2022","I was impressed with how accurate AmeriSave's information was, and it was pretty easy to follow what they needed from me every time. The originator was in constant contact with me and answered all my questions quickly. They're a great company to deal with. The complete online application took a bunch of hours because I had to pull all sorts of data together for it. It was about 12 hours in total. AmeriSave's rep was too straightforward and reliable with what he said. Nothing surprised me. The one beef I have with them is pretty minor. When they gave me the estimates, they put in an absurdly low number for title insurance. It went way up at the time of closing. They said they couldn't figure it out before then, but they could've given me a little better estimate. Still, they gave me very good terms. Considering the market, they were par with the best offer than one other group. So, I feel like I got a pretty good deal with them.",5
John,"Fort Worth, TX","Reviewed March 8, 2022",I got a 15-year fixed mortgage with Amerisave. Their rate was lower than any of the other offers I had and they were very prompt.,5
Hazel,"Virginia Beach, VA","Reviewed March 7, 2022","AmeriSave's application process didn't take very long at all. It was easy to get the documents that they needed, too, but I had an interesting situation because I had just done it a couple of months before. My marital status changed and I was like, ""Oh, I need to redo this in my own name."" The representatives were nice and helpful and I didn't have any issues with any of them. As far as the rates, they were pretty competitive. I did shop around and I got a better term with Bank of America and AmeriSave is able to match it.",5
Robert,"Bismarck, ND","Reviewed March 7, 2022","I did a refinance a year ago with Amerisave and I'd gotten another text message saying that interest rates were way low. I kicked that in then we did another refinance. This one was a long one though because there was a home equity loan that was still tied in to the home loan and we had to reevaluate the value of the house. We had to show them that with the reduced payments, everything was gonna be fine. From start to finish, it was probably 100 days. Everybody says it's about 60 more than normal. But there was nothing that anybody could do. It was something we had to show and work with U.S. Bank. They signed off on it right away once we showed them that everything was fine. After that, everything was good. Everybody has been really great to work with. I called in to change 'cause I wanted to maintain online payment. The lady showed me how to go about changing from my old loan number to the new one.",5
Jane,"Port Orange, FL","Reviewed March 6, 2022","This is our second time we've done AmeriSave. The first time was a bit more intensive because they didn't know us and we didn't know their process.

She was available at any time of day. Even if it was on a Saturday and I'd send a note, miraculously there'd be an answer back. AmeriSave is fabulous and I've referred them to a gazillion people.",5

Also, we had a few other things that we had gotten through that time that I didn't realize that would be a problem. Like I got my wife a diamond deal, and it was 0% interest for six months. They picked up on it and so then I had to get stuff. The process was easy, but it took a while.",5
Arturo,"Houston, TX","Reviewed March 5, 2022","The rep was very informative about everything that was gonna happen. He was very helpful and he told me what to do.

But there was a lot of communication for a while, it was a little confusing. There was too much computer-generated communication and then when I talked to a human, we were on different timelines. Otherwise, they were great. They got it done and they carried through. I also could almost always get hold of them. If not, they responded promptly.",4
Mark,"Waynesville, NC","Reviewed March 3, 2022","AmeriSave had a good rate and a quick turnaround. I went from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage.

But it took about 30 days from the time I first talked to them until the time we closed. They got hung up when it came to my appraisal. I applied with them six months before, but they couldn't do my loan at that time because I refinanced previously and six months hadn't gone by. So when they went to order my appraisal, it said that they couldn't get a control number because there was already an appraisal in there. ",5

We discussed it and I was happy with what he had. He was the first one to get back to me and I liked what he had done. He was in contact with me every day asking me to submit all this other stuff and he was professional. I joked with him and said he talked faster than I could listen. I told him he had to slow down because I had hearing aids and I couldn't listen as fast as he did. He was a very pleasant young man to work with.

Then, the website had everything. It had all the tasks that you need to do and was well-written. It was easy to understand what they needed and I couldn't experience an easier way to get a mortgage. The reps all did a great job. I called them personally and thanked them.",5

Other than that, the loan officer, George, was amazing. I originally found AmeriSave last summer when I refinanced. Then, I recently purchased another home and used George again. He was the only reason I used AmeriSave again. George would answer my phone calls and emails immediately while the underwriter would only talk to me about once a week. I just got unlucky and got a underwriter who had too much on her plate. All in all, I would recommend George to friends but I would keep my fingers crossed that I got a different underwriter next time.",5
Juliette,"Alpena, MI","Reviewed Feb. 26, 2022","I talked to a couple of other companies and wanted to keep to a fairly specific budget. A lot of them kept trying to offer me way more money than I wanted to spend. It sounded good, but I felt that they weren't listening to what I was asking and AmeriSave was. They stuck to what I told them. They listened to what I was trying to accomplish and what I wanted to do. I was really happy with that. My rep, Rowena, was awesome. I'm a first-time homebuyer and was also kind of freaking out because from the time I started the process to the time I got the loan, it was such a whirlwind that I wasn't even sure what I was doing. But Rowena was responsive. She never made me feel like I was bothering her or asking stupid questions. She was on top of it and helped to make me comfortable with the whole process and keep me calm when I started freaking out.",5
Abdul,"Moreno Valley, CA","Reviewed Feb. 26, 2022","For the most part, the online application was smooth and straightforward. I got transferred to Tiffany after my agent's license expired for California. She was responsive and prompt in getting things done. The terms I got turned out to be beneficial. I was looking for something a little lower, but I was told that a lower rate is not necessarily the cheapest rate. But my refinance took a long time in the process.",5

Cynthia,"Monroe, GA","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2022","Doing a home improvement type loan was a process I've never done before and the loan officer didn't make me feel like I was an idiot with questions I asked. So, he was very courteous. No question was a dumb question. But sometimes, the days off of the person who started the process with me didn't coincide with when I had questions and it might have been passed on to somebody else. Sometimes I’d get a message back from somebody different and it took a while to understand that part of it. It wasn't a problem but it would be good to know that there could be several people right up front that could be dealing with answering questions. ",5
Anthony,"Port Saint Lucie, FL","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2022",Everybody was helpful at AmeriSave and I appreciated that. Everything went smoothly and the application process seemed easy.

That was why we paid to make sure we kept that rate since we know rates are starting to go up.,5

Whenever I needed to get ahold of someone, they picked the phone right away and gave me the answers I needed. I got a decent rate and terms. It worked out as expected. It was a great experience. My first experience years ago was horrible. I was self-employed so it made it more difficult. This time, it was through standard employment so it was much easier.",5

The lady that I dealt with was very nice, understanding, and did everything to make it as easy on me as possible. I would recommend AmeriSave. After they gave me a little time, it was one of the smoother ones I've ever done.",5
Gregg,"Fremont, IN","Reviewed Feb. 20, 2022","I used AmeriSave before for a previous mortgage. When it was time to refinance, I went back to them. The reps were as good as I could have hoped for and very competitive. There was the advisor, my primary contact, so we got it going. There was also a female that I talked to and she helped on the paperwork side. That was probably my last ever mortgage. But if I get the opportunity to do another one, I would, and the only phone call I would make would be right back to them.",5
Lance,"Maize, KS","Reviewed Feb. 19, 2022","AmeriSave went through some management changes. Leonard is the loan originator. His job is just to get the people in the door, and then he's got other people that do the rest of the process, yet they couldn’t get the rest of the process done. It took about 12 months to close my refinance. Leonard would apply for a payoff from USDA where I had my other home loan, and it would take them three weeks to get a payoff back because they were so bogged down. They had always blamed Coronavirus. Then by the time they got a payoff, it took AmeriSave another three or four working days to get everything else ready to close at the closing, the 30 days is up to the payoff. We came up with the idea to apply for a payoff, and two weeks later apply for another one, so when it ran out, we still had two weeks that’s good on the second one. Leonard was a lifesaver and the only reason I got it closed.",3
Gary,"Kewanee, IL","Reviewed Feb. 19, 2022","When I met Laurie, her customer service steered me to go with AmeriSave. I kept doing everything that she directed me to do and it turned out great. I got a good deal with the rates too. I was using a VA home loan so it was different than a traditional loan. But I did have a bankruptcy within the last year, so I know that took some special gloves to make all that happen. It's just that during the process, they asked me to get this and that. If there could have been a list of things I need instead, the process wouldn't have been prolonged to two months. But it worked in the end.",5
Christopher,"Parlin, NJ","Reviewed Feb. 18, 2022","There was a little confusion with the dashboard that AmeriSave uses. They would set up the first one for submitting all the legal documents and I was under the impression that that was my primary dashboard. Meanwhile, once the loan was completed, there was another dashboard I was supposed to go to, a different URL, and create a different login or registration. From there, I can manage and review my mortgage, set up my bill payment, automatic payment, and all that stuff. Maybe I just missed it or there was a fine print somewhere I didn't see it. It was my first time doing it so a lot of it was new to me too. My mortgage was through the primary bank that I use for my checking and it was very easy for me to manage everything from my app. That was my hesitation about refinancing. I didn’t want to change that because I'm used to things being automatic and then not having to worry about it.",5

The website told me exactly what they needed, and I could see when I put it in and that they received it. Just makes the communication so much easier than having to email or call. When I have access to all the documents and I see everything in real time, it looks more transparent. If we had any questions, we just text AmeriSave and they texted us back or called us if it was a long answer.",5
Martin,"Bedford, MA","Reviewed Feb. 15, 2022","It was my second time that I went through the process. And I had such a good experience with the person I dealt with that I trusted his judgment. The first time around, the pandemic was starting and there were all kinds of gyrations in the marketplace. And he was able to get something done for me that saved me a bit of money a month. I saw the interest rates dipping again, and the opportunity to get a low interest rate would go away. So I asked him again, “Is this a good time? It seems early.” But he got me something. I went from 3.1 to a 2.6. I was very happy with that.",5

Anthony,"Cumming, GA","Reviewed Feb. 14, 2022","I signed up with AmeriSave in October. I had to wait a little bit because I didn't have a year of track record. I didn't have a year of commissions. Other than that, AmeriSave's application process was incredibly easy and straightforward. I'm familiar with the process. Without the wait because of the commission issue, the process would have probably taken seven days total. Once I got a year of commissions, AmeriSave got me approved and I was done.",5
A.,"Al, AL","Reviewed Feb. 14, 2022","I was comfortable working with AmeriSave. The only thing that I had a problem with is stuff that came up close to closing. Everything that should have come up, should have come up while we were in the process, and they shouldn't still be asking me for stuff a week or two before closing. It was aggravating. Before closing, I should know that I am locked in and approved. It shouldn't be the day of or the day before closing. They should look into that, so people won't be worrying the day before closing, ""Am I gonna close today?"" Other than that, the application process was easy and quick, and while the whole loan process took a long time, I can understand that. They also did the best they could based on our credit score, so they did good. Our representative was really good and very understanding.",4
Arkadiy,"Beverly, MA","Reviewed Feb. 13, 2022",I got emails about some offers and good rates so I called AmeriSave.

And you're gonna see that and yada, yada, yada."" That was extremely helpful. And his patience was remarkable. I'm pleased this is the first time that I ever had a delay of making my first monthly payment for two months. That was fantastic as well.

One thing that was a little strange was that they sent us the payoff for the loan for the car to Ford Credit. When anything like that happened, they always sent the money to the vendor. But this time it came here which meant we had to overnight it to Ford which cost us $50. ",5

They emailed and texted, and each offered a conversation on the phone if I needed more information. The person that I dealt with the most was constantly in touch with me and kept me informed.

Maybe it would be easier to go with the same company than try to refinance with a different company so I went with AmeriSave.

Though I did end up signing with a different lender because of other considerations, I am here stating that he was awesome and even better than my new lender taking the time to answer my number questions, compare apples to apples and ensuring I could get the best deal for me and my family.

They didn't follow through with what they said they would do far as calling back and getting things set up. Amerisave responded as quickly as they said they would. Their rep Tessa did a great job with us. She followed through. I had somebody that was supposed to have met one day and something happened that they didn't make it. I called her because I hadn't heard from them and she got things set up.  This was on a Friday before a holiday and we were set up the next Tuesday.",4
Christal,"Pasco, WA","Reviewed Feb. 3, 2022",Everything happened really fast and I was super impressed with it. They reached out and were pretty quick about it and told me exactly what I needed. It was really cool because I was able to watch the loan process go through. It was a great experience. I've gone through a different lender before and it wasn't this smooth.,5
William,"Petal, MS","Reviewed Feb. 3, 2022","Everything went smoothly. Chris, the guy I worked with, was extremely personable. He is definitely a great communicator. He gave us a lot of good information and answered all our questions. I felt comfortable talking with him. We both hobbied around RC cars as well, so we had a personal conversation along with it. Made us bond a bit better. That’s great for businesses to try to connect with people on a personal level. Also, I feel fortunate to be able to get a rate at that level, something that we were hoping to get to when we built our home. It has all worked out great.",5
Gary,"Dacula, GA","Reviewed Feb. 2, 2022","I sent AmeriSave an inquiry on a Tuesday night and 10 days later, we closed. It was that simple and the people I dealt with were great.

Charles,"Spicewood, TX","Reviewed Feb. 2, 2022","Justin, the guy we talked to, did not act like he was trying to shoot me a lot of crap. I was talking with Wells Fargo and it dragged on and on, and I got tired of messing with it. Every day, they wanted a little bit of information and it seemed like they were trying to drag it out until the interest rate went up. They had the original mortgage and it was at a real low interest rate. So, I did a refinance with AmeriSave and the rate was fair. But right now, I’ve got a little problem with them. They gave me a couple payment slips, where to send the payment to, and it was due the 1st of this month. I sent the payment to Atlanta, Georgia, which was where it said to send it. Then I got a letter the other day that I was supposed to send it to Dallas, Texas. So now, I don't know where to send it. I talked to them last week sometime but I hadn't heard back from them.",5
Cathy,"Oceanside, CA","Reviewed Feb. 2, 2022","We were looking to refinance our house and with AmeriSave, I was impressed that someone responded back to me immediately. The rep who reached out was great and the application was done over the internet. I submitted the documents through the DocuSign website they use now and I didn't have to talk to anybody until we signed the final papers when they came to the house. We were closed in 15 days. I've owned four homes and refinanced several times and this was the easiest that I have ever done. The rate was higher than the rate that we had but what we were trying to get rid of was our private mortgage insurance and by getting rid of that, we saved $300 a month.",5
Michael,"Litchfield Park, AZ","Reviewed Feb. 2, 2022","The refinance process was fast, and the customer service was excellent. If I asked one question, they didn't send me to someone else to answer it. It was the same person that would answer the question, even if it wasn't their department.",5
Robb,"Sun Lakes, AZ","Reviewed Feb. 1, 2022","The application process was very efficient and it worked well. Also, the rep I worked with was great and would go right back to me if I had a question.

James,"Raleigh, NC","Reviewed Feb. 1, 2022","I've refinanced before and I thought AmeriSave was great. The guy that helped me out, Merle, did an excellent job. He walked me through everything and he stood by me.

I've already referred him to a couple of people because he helped me out a whole lot.",5
Jose,"Kearny, NJ","Reviewed Feb. 1, 2022",They were very quick with their responses. They contacted me right away and kept me updated. They gave me all the information I asked for and made it a smooth process. I was very satisfied working with them. I got a pretty good rate compared to what the current market was.

Noor,"Moreno Valley, CA","Reviewed Jan. 31, 2022","AmeriSave's rep gave me a call and their refinancing process was really quick. Everybody was there to help out and information was transferred back and forth early and efficiently. The process was completed in two weeks and I haven't had a problem. Initially, you have to collect documents but you just got to get that process out of the way. They were also making sure that all the paperwork was put together and after that, everything was a breeze.",5

Timothy,"Ankeny, IA","Reviewed Jan. 30, 2022","I enjoyed the process. It was the easiest I've ever done as far as refinance. Seth was real responsive.

We just texted back and forth.",5
William,"Streetsboro, OH","Reviewed Jan. 30, 2022",Chris answered my questions and walked me through the process really quick. We were almost done after the first call. It was a very smooth and easy process. It was effortless on my part and theirs.,5

William,"Crossville, TN","Reviewed Jan. 28, 2022","I had no problem working with their reps except they kept changing on me. I first worked with this guy and the next thing I knew, it was turned over to somebody else. Then, shortly after that, it was turned over to the third person for closing. But they were all right. Also, everything went pretty smoothly and the rate was better than what I had before.",4
Alex,"Katy, TX","Reviewed Jan. 28, 2022","The computer kept on asking for information and for me to put in some of the things that they need, which I have already submitted and done. It got kind of repetitive getting all those emails and when a couple of people kept on calling. But the person I'm working with, Michael, was very helpful. I would send him an email and he would take care of it. Also, the rate that was given was good. I asked for a lower rate and he helped me with the computation and said the higher rate will be better in the long run.",5
Cami,"New Boston, TX","Reviewed Jan. 28, 2022","The person who worked with me was very nice and polite. They made the process very easy for me to do. Any questions I had, they answered.

Darrin,"Florence, NJ","Reviewed Jan. 27, 2022",The rep I initially spoke with was really helpful and her communication was good throughout the whole process. We did a lot of stuff through texting and email. It was fine but I would rather have done a little bit more on the phone.,5
Mike,"Bois D Arc, MO","Reviewed Jan. 27, 2022","During the first part of the process, I couldn't get a response back from whoever was in charge of my loan and we couldn't get anything done. It was hard to get ahold of somebody in charge. Then I finally got ahold of an office manager and they reassigned me to a guy named Matthew. From there on, it all went well.",3
Joseph,"Larose, LA","Reviewed Jan. 27, 2022","Their portal was straightforward and everything I needed to see was there. Customer service was enjoyable. They answered everything I had questions for. They worked with me on my timeline and didn't pressure me. The rep told me when he'd call me back and he actually did. That was pretty different from the norm. The application process wasn't overly complicated. It went easier than when I bought my house. For the final documents, they sent somebody to my house to deal with me in person. We went through a big stack of paperwork page by page and signed everything. Then they notarized it and shipped it off.",5
Radmila,"Beverly Shores, IN","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2022","The process from application to closing was outstanding. The loan officer that I dealt with was great, reassuring, knowledgeable, and professional.",5
Brandon,"Somerville, TX","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2022",I went through the introductory process with a lot of different lenders and they were the most knowledgeable and professional. Everything went great and I was happy with my rep's help.,5
Angel,"Fayetteville, AR","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2022","The process took a little bit longer than I thought it would. They were able to help me out, but I was constantly having to update stuff. All my paycheck stubs are all digital so sometimes, the only way I have access to it is by being at work on the computer. That kind of made having to keep updating a little bit of a hassle. But Jennifer, the person that I was working with, was there to help me throughout the whole step of the process and it helped to alleviate a lot of the stress that comes with all the paperwork. At times, I would call after hours and she would still take my calls. That was really something that stood out to me.",5
Wayne,"St. Joseph, MO","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2022",The application process with AmeriSave was simple and I was content with them. The rep was awesome and went above and beyond. I had a little trouble with Terminix doing my wood-destroying insect inspection and we were close to the deadline to be able to close before the Thanksgiving holiday. She got everything through underwriting with 10 minutes to spare. She was great with communicating and letting me know where we were every step of the way and what I needed to do. I was happy with the rate and the terms. It was everything I was expecting.,5
David,"Ontario, OH","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2022",The application process was pretty straightforward. The two people that I worked with were excellent and very professional. The only thing that took a little bit of time was trying to get the appraisal re-accomplished because it was a little bit what I considered low. But it ended up going through okay and I was very happy with the rate and terms.,5
Lynn,"Plainfield, IN","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2022","We were done from application to closing in around two weeks. The customer service team was very good. We used JR both times and his assistant Stevie was very thorough. I knew what to expect as far as what paperwork I needed so once they gave me the application, I was able to get everything to them and it closed very quickly. I got a competitive rate. Also, their computer portal is easy to use. That way, communication is excellent. They were very easy to get ahold of. I highly recommend them.",5
Wayne,"Kingman, AZ","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2022","AmeriSave was really professional when we had dealings over the phone.

Jacqueline,"Sarasota, FL","Reviewed Jan. 24, 2022","The process was a little slower than I expected with AmeriSave, but everything was pretty good. It was around the holidays and the it took six to eight weeks to complete. The rate and terms that they gave me were okay but there were quite a bit of fees involved to get that rate. I didn’t think I was going to have to do that because I mortgaged with them a couple of months prior. I was going to do a 15-year mortgage, but it was too much for me. So, I went back to a 30. Besides that, their rep always responded.",4
Jerry,"Pineville, KY","Reviewed Jan. 23, 2022","The closing cost was too much, which I was told by the representative that I talked to that he would pay half of the closing cost, but that never happened. He said that he spent too much time on it. He already gave me his best rate. That was the best they could do after we both agreed that was what I had to have before I went through the long process. If they tell you something that they will do this or that, get it in writing before you close the deal. Also, AmeriSave should keep in touch with me and let me know what is going on. Other than that, I liked the way he talked.",5
Saul,"Compton, CA","Reviewed Jan. 22, 2022","AmeriSave Mortgage beat everybody else's rate. What I wanted and I asked for is what I ended up getting. The correspondence of the two guys that helped me correspondence was really good. When I asked for certain things, they were quick to respond. Left a good impression on doing business with somebody. Also, they were a lot quicker than I'm used to. They drag their feet pretty good, so they were pretty good.",5
Carlos,"West Valley City, UT","Reviewed Jan. 21, 2022","The customer service was really good. I felt that I had a good connection with the rep. Because I have her cellphone number, which is a direct number, I don't have to call and go through an operator, then go from a different selection of menus and they will miss it and wait for somebody to call me back. And with Candace, it was really good. She was always available. When I had a question, I dialed her number, she would pick up. And I have all the questions, she had an answer whatever question I had. She was very knowledgeable, very patient, and professional. It made me feel really good. Also, the rates and fees were lower. Overall, a great experience.",5

For the first two or three months, I kept getting pushed from representative to representative and nobody could tell me what was wrong, why the application wasn't going through. But it went smooth. The last representative I had told me, “I'm new with the process.” But she was amazing to deal with. And anytime I called, she was always there. If she wasn't there, I would leave a message. She always got back to me. Also, the rate was better as far as the interest rate and the terms.",5

We started the process in July and we did not close until November. ",5

Everything was online, though we filled out the stuff verbally with the loan agent to get things going. The process was not difficult at all and the rep knew what was going on. She was informative and she had a great personality. Her customer service was dynamic. But there were some communication errors within their organization that documents weren't being recorded correctly. Fortunately, we were able to catch those. Other than that, the process was smooth and they were efficient. For the most part, things worked out pretty well, we got what we wanted, and they ultimately met their promises.",5

They were all courteous, too. Every time I called their rep, Antonio, he was always really good to me. But there was a $500 deposit and he told me that I'd get it back at the end of the signing. Then, I came to find out, when I read the contract at the very end, that the $500 deposit I put in was non-refundable. But I didn't read the fine print and it was my fault for not reading it. I just assumed that I heard him say that I was going to get it back when the papers were signed and maybe he didn't explain it right. But other than that, I was happy with him. I also got cheaper rates than I could have gotten anywhere else.",5
Wendy,"Roswell, GA","Reviewed Jan. 16, 2022","Our original originator was really thorough, explained everything to us, gave us all of our options, and was easy to work with. We ended up having to make a few changes and they did those very quickly. When we were originally refinancing, both of my husband and I were on the loan. But my job situation changed. I am self-employed now and own a business, so I don't have income. Because of that, we had to change it to my husband's name only, with me just on the title. We were fine with that. But when that happened, AmeriSave said they were gonna move everything over. They already had all of his information. ",4
Steve,"North Liberty, IA","Reviewed Jan. 15, 2022",The online application process was different but it went fairly well once we got through all the hurdles of getting to communicate better.

It was easy. I thought I was automatically going to do the direct payments on the day of closing. However, I found out after that I had to set that up after. Maybe it was a miscommunication on my part, but it's all good now. It was a great experience.",5

He also looped in an additional support staff member of his team that also helped at certain times.

I contacted AmeriSave for initially just one, but I was very fortunate to where the guy, Sean, said he could do all three. In my experience in 20 years, mortgage people are the graveyard of used car salesmen. Oftentimes, what they tell you is there’s nothing more that they can do, but Sean did good. Not only did he do that, he also closed within 45 days, lowered my rates from 5.75, 4.25 with a mortgage insurance and a 12% hard money loan to 2.66 with 100 grand cash out and 3.3 on the other properties.

Karen,"Idabel, OK","Reviewed Jan. 8, 2022","Roy was the person that I worked with. He walked us through the process, and it took a bit of time but he was on top of it the entire way. On the other hand, the underwriters need to pay more attention. Apparently, there are several underwriters working on the same loan, and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have kept asking for the same information. Roy said, “Don't worry about it. You already sent it to me. I'll get it over to them.” He anticipated things and got ahead of it. Overall, I would recommend AmeriSave. In fact, I sent somebody over to Roy before the end of our process was done. If you can work with Roy, go for it.

I got the same rate as I had before, so I didn't take a back fall on that and was able to make some progress financially with the new loan. So it was all good. AmeriSave is a company you can rely on. If I end up purchasing a home or another refinance, AmeriSave is who I'd look for.",5

The underwriters were a little bit lame though as far as getting it together because they were inexperienced. One person in there was Terri and she was excellent. I even commented to her bosses. They worked very well as a group, too.",5
Ralph,"Powder Springs, GA","Reviewed Jan. 4, 2022","The process took a month. There were some back and forth things 'cause AmeriSave wanted to change it a bit with getting it in by the end of November instead of doing it a little later, but we didn't have a problem with that. I also sent them a thank you to the rep Trevor. I enjoyed working with him. He was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the process. He helped us once before as well. The first time we went through AmeriSave, then we redid it in November, after five years. Trevor said, ""More than likely that AmeriSave will sell the contract to someone else,"" and they did. I thought it'd be at least a month.",5
Srinath,"Bentonville, AR","Reviewed Jan. 3, 2022","AmeriSave's customer service was excellent and the process was pretty smooth and normal. Getting the approval took a week. I faced an issue related to the cashier's check while closing. They hadn't informed me that I needed to give the cashier's check while closing and I came to know about that only on the day of the closing. If they informed me about it, that would have been great.",5
Anthony,"Moneta, VA","Reviewed Jan. 3, 2022","Everything was seamless, and the rep Ryan was always on top of things and very polite. I wanted to try to find the lowest rates and get it in for a fixed 30-year with minimal cost, and we were able to accomplish that.",5
Roy,"Lexington, SC","Reviewed Jan. 2, 2022","Refinancing with AmeriSave was the easiest home loan I've ever gotten. I did a lot of the free stuff over the phone with the gentleman that called me and the online application was pretty straightforward. We closed within a couple of weeks but there was a little bit of miscommunication. I would upload a form and the website would ask me to upload it again. Then I'd have to call and tell them that I uploaded this form and they'd have to manually look and confirm that I did upload it. It was my DD 214 from the military and they asked me to do a couple things twice but it was not a big deal. I'm not saying that the system is bad because it was very convenient to know what they needed. And when you uploaded the docs, the website would checke it off the list. ",5
Joseph,"Martin, TN","Reviewed Jan. 2, 2022","The only time I had a major issue with the process online was when we just got done filling out all that information on Rocket Mortgage, AmeriSave requested it all over again. There was a sketchy feeling there for a minute. But other than that, we accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish. I would recommend AmeriSave.",5
Rebecca,"Winterville, NC","Reviewed Jan. 2, 2022","Amerisave was great. From the time that we applied until the time that we had our closing and finished, it was less than a week. In fact, it was all happening so fast it was scaring me because I'd never done anything like this online. I was giving all my information and I was so anxious that this was for real ‘cause it was almost too good to be true. It wasn't until we closed that I thought, “Wew, that really did happen.” We didn't have to wait for an appraisal, which would have added a huge amount of time. We also dropped from a 4.5 to a 2.5, which is significant. Overall, we were very pleased and quite impressed.",5

I would recommend AmeriSave and refinance again. It was a great experience.",5
Jeff,"Mechanicsville, VA","Reviewed Jan. 1, 2022","AmeriSave had a little bit more clear understanding compared to other companies about what my costs were going to be upfront. I'm happy with them.

Michael,"Rockford, MI","Reviewed Dec. 31, 2021","When I first called Amerisave, they told me what I needed to do and how they needed to get started. I gave them all my information, and everything was good. The only hiccup we had was on my home. Since I didn't have a lien on the property, I couldn't get a VA loan, so I had to go with a standard one. It went all the way to underwriting before they found out. We had to do a second appraisal but I didn't have to pay for it which was good. After that, it was really quick. Everything was done within a day or two. I could text my rep, Nino, and he would get right back to me, which was real convenient. He had a few other people that were involved and they stayed on top of it. ",5

I told him what we were looking for, what we wanted and needed, and he was able to meet those expectations and then helped shape those expectations also. We communicated sometimes daily because I had a lot of questions. With the online portal, I could review everything and see the document. It made it so easy, almost to the point where I thought, ""This can't be this easy."" But it actually was. We were able to get to the loan table and to closing within 30 days. I did all this while working. It took no extra time outside of my regular day, so it was effortless. We have a daughter who is looking to purchase her first home and AmeriSave is definitely where we're gonna go to help her get that taken care of.",5
Alexander,"Anchorage, AK","Reviewed Dec. 30, 2021","My rep, Joe, was super awesome. He broke everything down to somebody that doesn't understand mortgage and refinance. He explained to me in detail to where I understood where all the money was going, how I’m saving money by refinancing, and the cost of the loan versus the interest rate. We talked on a regular basis and he was super awesome every step of the way. It was nice getting the extra information versus being rushed through the process. So far, I've been super happy with the process and everybody I've talked to over at Amerisave.",5
Clayton,"Hillsboro, OH","Reviewed Dec. 30, 2021","AmeriSave's online application process worked well. It was streamlined and easy enough. I liked it.

AmeriSave is very beneficial.",5
Emanuel,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Dec. 30, 2021","The process was extremely easy, efficient, and quick in comparison to other lenders that I've worked with in the past.

Margaret,"Blackstone, MA","Reviewed Dec. 29, 2021","They were super quick to respond and I got a direct text message to my phone from the guy who did my loan. Communication was really good and the portal was easy to use. There was one point where I was a little frustrated  I hadn't heard back and was really nervous. But that was on me because I'm refinancing 'cause of a divorce. The rep was really patient. It turned out that his grandfather had died so he had been out of commission. He told me he was just getting back from the funeral. Once we straightened that out, they were very responsive.",5
Zachary,"Mount Bethel, PA","Reviewed Dec. 29, 2021","When I talked to all of AmeriSave's employees, everything was very smooth. Everyone was very helpful.

Joshua,"Huntsville, AL","Reviewed Dec. 29, 2021","The application process was pretty simple. But there was a point where I wanted more information on what they were asking, and I wasn't sure if I sent the right thing. It'd be nice if I had a little bit of feedback online. It was hard reaching my loan officer. Sometimes she was so busy, so it was hard to know if I did the right thing or get questions answered. I had to wait for her to get back to me. She had a lot of people to take care of and I understood that. But sometimes I didn't get my question answered till two or three days later. But it was a good process. It went smooth and moderately fast.",4

Debbie,"Mount Dora, FL","Reviewed Dec. 28, 2021","The application process was very easy. I did everything online and by phone. The reps were very good and helpful. I had a 25-day closing or approval crunch. If not, the seller was gonna walk away. AmeriSave understood that and they got everything done on time. The two processors I worked with were great. I was surprised at how easy it was. The rate that I got was below than what I expected. I'm very happy with it.",5

I have handled loan closings professionally as an attorney and have had more than 15 mortgage loan closings personally and never encountered the incompetence as I had with Amerisave. Throughout the process I would receive erroneous Closing Disclosures that had incorrect loan amount, interest rate. I would receive erroneous communications announcing that they had terminated my loan since documents had not been received which was not true. It would take numerous calls/emails to get these items corrected causing delay. In fact, I repeatedly sent documents over and over again. As self employed, I am accustomed to providing several years of tax returns but when they requested a tax return almost 5 years old, I said NO and they agreed.",1

Maria,"Warren, PA","Reviewed Dec. 26, 2021","I chose AmeriSave because I liked the person I talked to that gave me information. I know how my credit is, where I stand, and the money I have. I only needed to have an idea of how much it would be, and the reps were very helpful. Instead of running my credit, which upsets me incredibly, they just gave me a bulk idea of what it would be. I felt confident enough, then I moved forward and did the refinance with them. Everybody else wants to run your credit, so that's a big difference for me. I also had questions throughout the process, and the guy I worked with was knowledgeable and helpful. Above all, he listened to what I needed and gave me very fair options for me to choose from.",5
Craig,"Powell, OH","Reviewed Dec. 25, 2021","It was a little laborious going through all the iterations of what I perceived to be the final documents. Some things changed that were beyond anybody's control, and it was nobody's fault, but it could have been avoided had there been a little more communication about, ""Things aren't final until they're final."" Apart from that, the rep, Lacey, was fabulous, and my experience was better than I had hoped, overall. It was simple, and I'm pleased to do business with AmeriSave in the end.",5
Paul,"Cortez, CO","Reviewed Dec. 24, 2021","I called AmeriSave who had our present loan, and I said I wanted to refinance. They got me in touch with a loan processor, and I worked with three different people during the progression of the process. That's the way it was when I got my first loan too. My refinance went very well. That involved having a notary public come to our house and do the final signing. They sent that in and the money went right to my bank account. Overall, AmeriSave was wonderful to me. We had a seamless encounter, and I've refinanced my home successfully.",5
Brian,"New Bern, NC","Reviewed Dec. 23, 2021","AmeriSave was good to work with and the rate they provided was better than any of the other rates I got. I worked with Anthony and he was great.

The only thing that took a while was the appraisal of my house, which took three days. I had questions but they were all busy. Still, people should go for AmeriSave and give the guy a call.",5

He seemed very helpful and he wanted to do it, not that it was just a job. The rate was what I was looking for. I wish I would have known my house was gonna appraise more, but it is what it is.

I'm pretty happy with the way everything lined up and got closed. Everything was going on behind the scenes and I didn't have to deal with a lot. So once I got my credit score and found that it was okay, and then got my rate, I didn’t have to deal with AmeriSave a lot, which was good. They told me when I got the mortgage that I could pick my due date. But nobody got back to me on that. So they made my due date on the 1st. But I’d like to have it on the 15th or 16th of the month.

However, I didn’t like the person who puts the file together for the underwriter. Before her, I was using a guy named Steve. I was never irritated by him. With her, I didn’t feel she had a strong grasp of what I was saying. I’m a trustee of a trust that has nothing to do with my debt to income ratio and I have a debt to income ratio of probably zero. At the end of the day, the only thing that could happen was I write them a letter until they say I’m the trustee of the trust, which I did. But I felt it was too much confusion.

There were some little rough edges for me. I happened to be computer savvy for a long time I spent my career in data processing and computerized systems and engineering. Some things in the AmeriSave site weren't quite well-defined. I will suggest that when you start to use the task system that you get a little bit more information about it. I didn't understand that there were other parts of that that I could use, like to transfer my document. I thought I was only allowed to use the task part.

We went back and forth a couple of times over the phone. But it could have been better if AmeriSave gave an upfront list of what I needed for my employer. Everyone's working from home, so I had to submit things at least two or three times. I had to ask what I needed to say on some things. But once they clarified everything that needed to be on there and I submitted to my employer three times, we got what we needed.

There were a few questions I asked him, and he answered them swiftly and he was honest about it. It was kind of smooth. The rates were exactly where we were shooting for and the terms were decent as well. From start to finish, it was wonderful. AmeriSave is like a breath of fresh air.",5
Virginia,"Caldwell, ID","Reviewed Dec. 5, 2021",Michael was wonderful and he explained everything to me. I had been with Rocket Mortgage or Quicken Loans for years but I thought AmeriSave would be a better fit so I switched. The process was extremely easy and quick. I've never had it go so easy. It was such a great experience.,5
Ryan,"Henderson, NV","Reviewed Dec. 5, 2021","The reps at AmeriSave were good. I had Kyle primarily and then I ended up talking with another person. She was just as good, with whatever they needed. It worked really well. I had one text message and both of them were getting it. So that was handy. The rate was good. It was the same as I was getting anywhere else. The thing that made me use AmeriSave was the amount of credit that you got from whoever the lenders are in the background. Their approach was really good and everything transpired as they said. Usually, at closing, you're up in the air sometimes. But theirs, it was all tightly done. There was a glitch where they had thrown a document in for an apartment-type HOA thing that I didn't have. But Kyle was able to get it off within 24 hours.",5
Stephen,"Springfield, IL","Reviewed Dec. 5, 2021","Josh asked me what I was looking for and looking to accomplish, and he started working towards it immediately. So he actually heard me. The application process was pretty straightforward. The only difficulty was we would submit things and then it would still say that they weren't submitted. But it got ironed out pretty easily. The only real gripe I had about the process was their online interface with the issues of uploading things about four times because it wasn't going in.",5
Keith,"Hacienda Heights, CA","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2021","They processed my loan pretty quick. The rep explained everything to me and told me if I got everything back timely, it would go fast and it did. I was pleased with the process.",4
Barbara,"Freeport, FL","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2021","Thomas was very nice to work with. He was very prompt. If I ask questions, he answers them. He was a nice person to work with. Working with AmeriSave reduced the percentage on my loan, which is something I was working for. The timeframe was quick.",4
Melissa,"Morehead City, NC","Reviewed Dec. 4, 2021","I had a bit of trouble with a few items. But I just emailed and they got taken care of right away.

Go for it.",5
Claire,"Bay City, MI","Reviewed Dec. 3, 2021","I filled something out on Rocket Mortgage and Josh from AmeriSave was the first person that reached out to me. I liked him a whole lot so we went with him. Josh made the application process seamless. He stayed on with us and did an evening call so that we could do it around our work schedules. He kept in contact right up until it was approved. Also, we had all of our information at our fingertips and anytime we had a question, we had an answer within an hour. It went pretty solid.",5

Carol,"Turner, ME","Reviewed Dec. 3, 2021","This is my seventh property that I've bought between rentals and by all means this was the quickest and easiest. I was applied and closed in five weeks. The gentleman that I worked with was fantastic. But AmeriSave should post to the site if there was a list of the documents that we would need instead of constantly waiting and looking. The site would send me a message and tell me they needed an updated document. If I could have done it all at one time, it would have been great. Like if I would need a W-2 or a pay stub, I already know those things going in with a list that I could just put them there.",4

We started crunching all the numbers and it seemed like a really good option to me at the time. As we went along, it got better and better for me. I saved almost two points and almost $200 off my home loan. Lucas walked me through everything. I talked to another gentleman by the name of Robert and he explained to me all the situations and what I needed. Once I got all the paperwork lined up, it was a bang kind of thing.",5

Gabrielle,"Oaks, PA","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2021","The first person I interacted with never returned my phone call. The second guy that I dealt with at AmeriSave was great. He gave me different options. We discussed the different options as far as dropping the interest rate that I had previously. It was the best option for us. The only thing, I asked for the escrow to be put back into the mortgage, but I wound up getting a check when we signed the papers. Also, the paperwork that came in the mail said 1.75 and that's not what I got. I don't know why we're not getting 1.75. Both of us have excellent credit ratings.",4
Anthony,"Roscommon, MI","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2021","AmeriSave Mortgage had the lowest interest rate and the loan officer I was working with was thorough and very helpful. He was very knowledgeable of the process and everything I needed to know. I would talk to him about certain things and I would get a follow up email from somebody different regarding the loan. But they didn't know anything that I talked to my person, and they would ask him questions that would probably clear it up. If they talked to one another before sending an email, that would have worked out so there wouldn't be any confusion. Other than that, my interactions with them were very positive.",5
Tammy,"Belle Plaine, KS","Reviewed Dec. 1, 2021","The process with Amerisave was a lot easier than the process with my current lender. I didn't like paying the $500 because local lenders will let you do it for free but everything else seemed to run smoothly. I had really good credit and was wanting to get the 2.75. I ended up getting bumped up to 2.99 so that was kind of frustrating. But other than that, my rep always returned my calls and answered my emails in a timely manner. I didn't ever have to wonder where the status of my loan was at and that was nice. I got into my house within seven, eight weeks from the beginning to the end.",4
Marian,"El Paso, TX","Reviewed Nov. 30, 2021","The process with AmeriSave was smooth. We went from step to step and had no hurdles. We provided the proper paperwork and it was processed properly. The rep was responsive to my emails or phone calls and whenever I had questions, they were answered in a prompt time. The whole process took six months but it has nothing to do with the mortgage company. I got my pre-approval letter in less than two weeks and it was a new construction. The rates and terms were great. They were probably the best on the market at the time.",5
Mary,"Fort Walton Beach, FL","Reviewed Nov. 30, 2021",AmeriSave's communication was top-notch.

Kristen,"North Olmsted, OH","Reviewed Nov. 30, 2021","AmeriSave’s application process is very detailed and their reps are very polite and professional. When I had issues, the loan processor helped me through them. She was very knowledgeable too. The cost of financing was also good. I've never seen any company like that. However, I was not aware of the $500 application fee until I started getting into the internet stuff. Also, I don't understand why we get checks to pay these creditors. Why couldn't we wire funds straight to them. Someone like me who does everything off the internet don't print statements. I had to go do all of that, and I had to get stamps and envelopes so it was a little inconvenient. Nevertheless, I referred someone over to them.",5
Lindsay,"Woodbridge, VA","Reviewed Nov. 29, 2021","My house was refinanced in under a week, which was super-fast. It was a combination of not asking for too much and having all the documents ready. Plus, the guy that I worked with at AmeriSave was very responsive and super knowledgeable. He got everything done and got us a lower interest rate. It was a better deal than what the mailer had originally even said. We got the money for our refinance, which just came through. It looks easy to pay so if everything continues to work the way that it has, I'm very happy.",5
Pila,"Bluffdale, UT","Reviewed Nov. 29, 2021",We have refinanced with AmeriSave before and I had a good experience. They gave us the best rate. And I got to deal with the same person that I dealt with before. Those were important to us. I talked to one person. Everything ended up the way it started out. They were a better company just because of that. It was as easy as a mortgage can be. I was happy.,5
Danny,"Oak Harbor, WA","Reviewed Nov. 29, 2021","I liked that the people at AmeriSave spoke English. There were a few bumps but once Amerisave got that ironed out, it went pretty good. With the low interest rates, people are inundated with people doing refis so some of my emails got lost in the process. I had to duplicate emails two, three times and send copies two or three times. Also, some of the phone numbers that I would call didn't work. When I couldn't get ahold of the people I was working with and tried the other phone numbers, I wish that I would have been able to get ahold of those guys. Finally, I was able to get some other phone numbers and started calling other people. Apparently, they got ahold of the guy I was working with, and he called me back and answered my questions. With AmeriSave, I got my refinance done and my rate lowered.",3
Tyrone,"Columbia, SC","Reviewed Nov. 28, 2021","The rep gave me a list of everything I needed at one time and I got everything together that I needed to send AmeriSave. He explained every piece of information that they sent me and didn't just graze through the document. He took the time and took me through every piece of that paperwork that I did and explained to me what does what. Altogether, the application and underwriting process took a total of three weeks because they had a new guy that was over my account and he didn't know that everything was ready to get sent out to whoever the last person is in the process before I had to sign the paper.",5

The thing is you don't necessarily work with just one rep. It's whoever's in their office. So, we get texts or emails from one rep, and then the next one will follow up. Then at the end, the original loan officer person sent us an email saying thank you and congratulations. ",5

The first officer I had ended up quitting but even during the brief period that I worked with him, there was fantastic communication. It was the same thing with the second gentleman that came on. If I had any questions, he was on top of it. The assistant was fantastic as well. Anytime I had a question about something and she wasn't 100% positive, she'd find out and call me right back.

It took over a week to connect. The calls kept dropping, they were really distorted I couldn't hear or it took a really long time for somebody to answer. Also, the online confirmation for the release of mortgage documents through Equifax wasn't really brought up with anything so I was surprised when I had to do it and then it took so long. Other than that, the rep was really good. Everything was explained in layman's terms as well as business language. I know a little bit about financing and refinancing so it went pretty smoothly.

If I hadn't gotten that, I wouldn't have pursued it. My husband and I are really happy. The whole process was easy. Then he got us some extra money. I'm going to get new kitchen counters. So, it was wonderful. I did the process one morning. My husband and I were sitting in the living room with our phones, and Eric was on the other end. He was very patient.

I provided everything that was asked of me initially, including the $500 non-refundable fee. Shortly thereafter, my loan officer began demanding more & more information from me, a sizeable amount of which was inapplicable to the situation. Phone calls & emails went unanswered, voicemails unreturned, yet the situation never improved. I was eventually contacted by a random agent there who actually attempted to assist me, but was unlicensed, so she couldn't really do much besides send intracompany emails to other departments.",1

I had Amerisave review my information beforehand and they came back with saying they know how to work around it because they deal with it often, and they were right. I had three other companies that were dealing with it, and Amerisave was the only one that was able to come through.",5

Darcy,"Farmington, MN","Reviewed Nov. 18, 2021","The process with AmeriSave was extremely easy. We took some equity out of the house. We refinanced it because we decided to stay here after we retire. It freed everything up and made us relaxed. It's always nice to have some cash in the bank quickly accessed. AmeriSave was extremely timely and informative. They moved it along. If you looked like you were taking a little too long, they kind of prompted you like they should. The process was relatively quick which was really surprising. It was about as good as it could be, considering all the different things such as titles. It started on 9/11 and we were already done by 9/21. We had to wait for another week or two to get our money, but that's all right. ",5

Vinod,"Shirley, MA","Reviewed Nov. 15, 2021","The process was good.

We did all we could on our end to comply, but every time we got one form that we thought was the right one and it was done and over with, there was something else that they needed, or they didn't get it or it wasn't faxed to them. They bugged the heck out of the insurance company that I have the homeowners insurance with that they got a little frustrated having to get so many calls from various people that work for Amerisave asking for the same form.",2

We needed a lot of advice and he was very knowledgeable and helped us know what to do. We thought about it for a couple of days, and then we did the application. The approval took a while because for some very strange reason, they required appraisals even though we were only asking for 30% of the value, and we had to wait for that. When we started, our rep, Justin, told us it would take about 90 days, and it took pretty close to that. We were just upset that we had to blow $500 on appraisal. We didn't understand why that was required. We also would have liked to have had the rates a little bit lower, but we had had a bankruptcy in our past, so we understood that there are consequences for things, and we were very happy to be down at 2%. It was very good for us and it's going to allow us to help our son buy a house.",5

Their agent, Brian, was great and very responsive.",3

The only thing was all of a sudden, we started getting all these cards, and at the end, we figured out it wasn't from AmeriSave.

This time, Madeline got to the bottom of things and guided us through the fastest way. In our case, the loan would take longer, but she said if I went alone without my wife, we'd get it done, and she was right.

But I noticed when I called a few times to set up my auto payment that their whole system had some issue and I was not able to hear the person on the other end. The voice was breaking. She got my information and in between, the line got disconnected, not because of me but something happened with the phone system then on AmeriSave’s side. So they need to look into that. It was frustrating because getting the right people takes time. Then all of a sudden it got disconnected. And I expected a call back but I didn't get one, so I had to call back again later.

The rep I dealt with was courteous, helpful, and when she didn't know an answer, she was quick to find someone that did instead of just making stuff up. But the whole necessity of a notary is an obsolete process. They’ve got systems in place already and certainly, with the state of Texas, if you have an image of a person's license, you can verify his identity. All of that could be done online. So the closing ought to be online at this point, with the signing, software, and the ways to verify identity. Other than that, working with them allowed us to ditch our PMI.",5

Then, they don't even really realize what the laws of the state are with regards to sole and separate property. The property that I refinanced was mine so it was separate before the marriage even took place.

I’m divorced and it was in my old married name with my ex-husband, so that actually made me change it over, which I should have done years ago but I never did.",5
Richard,"Jefferson, GA","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2021","The reps were very easy to work with and t-fir the most part, anytime that I sent emails, either them or their manager would respond to my questions. The application and underwriting process took less than 20 days. It was quick. I was expecting though that the payout for the money that AmeriSave gave me back would be a direct deposit. But it came in an overnight check. I didn't realize it was doing that and I would have liked to have known that because it was sitting on my front doorstep when I got home one day.",5
Shantanu,"Edina, MN","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2021","AmeriSave was non-invasive. They're very good. They answered all my queries. The entire process took around a month, and the loan officer, Patrick, was prompt. Whenever I called him, he answered the call. Go for AmeriSave.",5
Medelin,"West Orange, NJ","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2021","AmeriSave could have provided information as to whether we would like to have our taxes and our home insurance under escrow or not. Also, they were charging points. We opted for not to have that charged because we would have to pay a higher closing cost. Also, they weren't as upfront with the closing costs. I wasn't happy about that. It would have made the process a little better if they would have informed us about the closing costs upfront and how the rate was low due to buying points, as well as how the money would be in escrow, and that would be like the monthly mortgage, instead of letting us have the option of removing it upfront. We couldn't get in contact with them after we finalized everything. After it passed to another department was very difficult for us to get ahold of them. Then in order to modify any changes to the whole mortgage, it's difficult.",3
Anita,"Palm Springs, CA","Reviewed Nov. 8, 2021","I love the gal I worked with. She did a great job. She was so sweet. She's the only thing that saved me. It was like, God, poor thing setting up me because I have seven homes and a lot of them are paid for. We had to go through each one. She was neat and was trying to be honest. The loan however stressed me out because AmeriSave Mortgage doesn't have anybody. When I talk to somebody, they kept giving me the same information. I turned it in, and it was a robot. I couldn't stand that. They would say, “What do you need now?” I turned it in and Gianna kept saying, “Don't pay attention to it. They just keep doing it.” I don't know that. Also, AmeriSave had to ask stupid questions. “Why do you have this house? How did you get this house? Why do you have this in the bank?” “Oh, for God's sakes. I'm a single woman, and I make a lot of money. Sorry. I don't have a husband.”",2
Bradley,"Brookhaven, GA","Reviewed Nov. 8, 2021","David, the rep, has always taken care of me so I go back to him always. He answers any questions well, always follows up, does things the right way and he explains everything well, which is rare in the industry, but makes everything very clear and has good customer service. The online application process is seamless and fast these days. It’s a lot less time than it used to take. It probably took me 15 minutes this time for the app. So, it was good. I had to send documents in but everything is very streamlined these days so my application didn’t take very long. If I shop around, I could probably find a slightly higher rate. But David lets me know when it's a good time to refi and I'm not worried about getting the cheapest because I get a good experience. I'm very happy with that experience. So, I'm not always looking for just the absolute lowest rate.",5

Geni,"Kennewick, WA","Reviewed Nov. 7, 2021","I made my first mortgage payment last month, but I got a letter in the mail stating that I could do the monthly automatic draft, or send in a check every month, which is fine. But AmeriSave does not offer the option to go on their website and make a payment each month, where any other house that I've purchased, I'm able to login and make my payment right then. I don't want anyone touching my bank account. They don't offer that. And I don't trust the mail system either. So if they do have it, it’s not offered in this letter. Other than that, they were very friendly. The loan officer helped me with several things. My husband and I contracted COVID in the process, which put us behind a couple of weeks. They were fixing to cancel it all because we couldn't provide all the information they needed in a timely manner. He pulled some strings and got it reinstated at the interest rate that we were promised. So we were very pleased.",4
Sanda,"Monroe, GA","Reviewed Nov. 7, 2021","I filled out part of the application, but I didn't finish it. Somehow, AmeriSave started calling me.

I'm in a good mood today. If I tell you exactly what I want and you tell me yes or no, I’ll do business with you.” The rep, Lucas, was amazing. He listened and he knew what he was doing. He met every one of my requests and we were able to close in a week. ",5
Jason,"Maricopa, AZ","Reviewed Nov. 7, 2021","We had already used AmeriSave previously. This time, the process took a little bit only because we started early. We had already gotten a refi and we had to wait for it to mature. But once that happened, it was pretty fast and within 30 days.",5

And it was super easy to get my information to her. I had all my information ready, so that probably helped the process a little bit. But it also went really fast. Then, the lady that she sent over to do the finding the documents was really nice. The man who came to do the appraisal was really nice as well. So it was the easiest experience that I've had.",5

Caleb,"Vacaville, CA","Reviewed Nov. 5, 2021","My loan servicer, Marguerite, worked really hard to give me the information I needed and did what it took to gain my business. I was pretty comfortable working with them though it seemed like there could be a bit better communication between the loan servicer. Marguerite, a few times, had to ask questions as far as whether or not documents were done or not, or documents had been sent to me because it seemed like someone else was sending them to me. But maybe she had her hands tied or maybe she could have had more information or been in the know more about things, just because someone else was doing some of the legwork. Other than that, the rate I got at first was not great. But because Marguerite was able to match other terms as far as interest rates, it became good.",4

Karl,"Chula Vista, CA","Reviewed Nov. 4, 2021","AmeriSave had a better overall pricing for what I was doing for my refi. I applied with them and the process was pretty easy. I worked with their rep, Jacob, who  was very knowledgeable and helpful. I knew they were kind of busy, so I understood that he had a lot of clients. But I've been trying to pay my mortgage since the first and I've called, left messages about five times a day, and I've got about five numbers that I called to leave messages with. They told me that I would have to sign up for auto pay and before I can get the auto payment, I’d have to make my first payment. But it's been hell trying to make that first payment and I finally got it in today. ",4
Dainon,"Waco, TX","Reviewed Nov. 4, 2021","Amerisave's customer service was really good. My rep was there every time I call and he answered the phone quickly. He had the answer or if there was something they didn't know, he at least would try to get an answer and get back to me right away. The process took a little longer than I would have liked but that was partly my fault because I had an addition that I was in the middle of completing before AmeriSave wanted the appraiser to come out. Also, if you're going to do a cash-out, then make sure you know that the 30-year rate's gonna go up on your interest.",5

But nine months is too long to wait for a loan. The process was not organized well. They wanted one thing here and I sent that to them, then they wanted one thing there. Instead of them giving you the whole list of what they want so you can send it all in and get it done within three months instead of nine, they dragged it out, which was not acceptable. They should have had a list ready and it could have all been there and end of story. Then, if they needed anything extra, it would have been fine.",1
Shalonna,"Reva, VA","Reviewed Nov. 3, 2021","The reps were very informative and polite. The application process didn't take long at all because everything was over on the internet. So, it's just plugging in your initials here and there. It was simple and a lot easier. I'm very happy with the fixed rate and a very low interest rate. I was able to lower my time on my loan. If people had any questions, AmeriSave is very willing to answer each and every one of them, so they don’t need to be shy about asking. AmeriSave breaks down everything to you where it's understandable and they’re helpful.",5

For one thing, doing this online is really scary because you're not seeing somebody, and you’d think they're not going to be available, but they were. Anytime I sent an email or forms, everything was done automatically online. If I ever had a glitch, I would just send an email and I’d have a response within the hour. Everyone was always available to answer any questions. There was always somebody on the phone with me when I was going through all the documents.

We were able to do everything electronically so, that was nice that we didn't have to hunt anything down and go any places. Signing was easy and done right at the house. So, everything was great. The only thing was when there were documents that were needed, I was getting three emails a day, saying that these were needed, even though I had sent them in already to Cameron. But he said those were auto sent. Our payments is going down on our house, which is awesome. We were able to pull cash out of our equity and still be able to save on our house payment.

My entire process was less than 30 days. There were some complications but it wasn't anything on anybody's behalf. There was an issue with the title. Other than that, everything was good and it was very quick. We had an appraiser come out and we had an appeal because the home was valued low.

I talked to the guy and he said that he could close me in under 30 days. The application process was simplified. This was not the first horse I ever rode and I had rentals too. They were all a pain in the neck but this is the best process I’ve ever had. I would like a little clarity on the address for payment though, even though it was in the closing docs. It'd be nice to have papers saying how much I’m going to pay so I didn't have to scan some documents again. That isn't even a necessity but a simplification on my part to make my life easier.",5

It was a very easy process going through. The online application process worked very well for me too. In the beginning, I was quoted an eighth of a point higher than what I wound up getting. The only reason was I had talked with another mortgage refinance company and they were wanting to have my business a lot. They offered me an eighth of a point lower without any extra points being bought. AmeriSave matched it, which was good for me because I was already halfway through the process. AmeriSave is professional. They did a spectacular job and I was very happy going with them. I would give people looking to refinance AmeriSave’s number so that they can give them a call and give them a chance.",5

The person I dealt with, Lori, has been fabulous and every time, I recommend her to other people. We have also done a few other purchases through them and I've always gone through Lori. Their process is expedient and mindless for me. Also, we've been really happy with our rate.",5

Stephen,"Cumberland, RI","Reviewed Oct. 13, 2021","The lending process with AmeriSave was good and it was transparent. I filled in the application and the rep told me what the different options were.

AmeriSave was able to keep in touch with us and check in and make sure we got everything we needed. Thankfully, they took care of it from point A to point B. Best rate I could get as far as I'd looked and done a little research. There were several other companies that were about the same rate, but they wanted to charge more fees.",5

Shelly,"Wernersville, PA","Reviewed Oct. 9, 2021","The gentleman I first spoke with explained everything and always answered my questions. But then, once that part was over and it was approved, it was really difficult to get in touch with someone. The loan hadn't been registered yet, I had a flood, and I was trying to find out what to do with the insurance check that I received. I would call and leave messages and no one ever called me back. I contacted Troy and he got me an address, and then it took weeks before I could ever speak with someone to find out where to send the check to. Now, it's been about six weeks because I needed their endorsement in order to cash the check and I still don't have my check back. They sent a notary here, which was convenient, and he was really nice and seemed really knowledgeable. But when he left, he forgot to take all the signed paperwork with him. So, he had to come back the next day and get the paperwork.",3
Sherine,"Missouri City, TX","Reviewed Oct. 8, 2021","Their process was excellent. AmeriSave is who I closed with from the beginning.

When a customer calls, that is something that the company needs to comply with. I got that from AmeriSave compared to the other lender. It's just sometimes my loan processor or whoever is taking care of the paper is out of sight or has no signal because of our time zone difference. But nevertheless, it's been patched up right away, so that's good.",5

Elizabeth,"Marietta, GA","Reviewed Oct. 6, 2021","The rep, Kimberly, contacted me immediately and seemed engaged, which made me want to engage with her, and therefore AmeriSave. She was the reason why I went them and why I stuck with the process. She clearly worked to make sure I got the best possible outcome and it was evident from the start that she would be somebody that would take ownership and follow up, and she did. But my property was undervalued probably by 70,000 so that prevented me from doing the mortgage product that we had first discussed. We did an appeal but the appraiser stuck by his guns and AmeriSave wasn’t allowed to order another appraiser. So that was the disappointing part. It wasn't them but the vendor and I totally understand that.",5

Every once in a while, there might be a slight delay in communication when trying to get some answers from email but it's kind of to be expected. Everybody doesn't live 24/7 by their work account.

Herman,"Coweta, OK","Reviewed Oct. 4, 2021","I was worried upfront. My credit’s not top-notch like it used to be so I had some stresses there. But it turns out I didn't need to stress. The loan officer was just as sweet as she could be. She was a joy to talk to and work with. She made everything go great. Being that I had never done this before, I ended up with a lot of questions and was always available when I had those. She was always patient and she was never perturbed with me calling again. The only issue was that the title company took forever to get a copy of the title from when I originally purchased the house. It turns out I was able to find my own copy. We were able to get my paperwork faxed in and use it. Overall, AmeriSave got my house refinanced and a lot of my debt taken care of. Give them a call.",5
David,"Tarpon Springs, FL","Reviewed Oct. 4, 2021","AmeriSave requested the typical documents about the house and it was a fairly easy process. Everything was uploaded to them automatically from me. Brittany, the rep, was very quick to respond back to me. It was quick communication and that was how I particularly liked it. I don't like waiting for days. It seemed we were on the same page of what we needed, what we were going to get and how quick we were going to get through the process. She was excellent to work with and she was very communicative. There was no lag time with her. ",5
Derek,"Lewis Center, OH","Reviewed Oct. 3, 2021","I was refinancing and the application process with AmeriSave was smooth and went well. The rate seemed to be better than my current rate and the terms seemed appropriate. For the most part, it was okay dealing with the customer service team. But I had some difficulty getting calls back a couple of times and I couldn't get through to someone on the phone. They should return the phone calls. Several times when I called and asked them questions, I didn’t hear anything back. Then a couple of days later, I got an email regarding that topic. It wasn't anything too bad but sometimes when you have questions in the moment, it's a little difficult to answer the email because I may not see it until later.",4

I felt good about him but when he quit, I got dropped and then Russel picked up and started answering my emails. I felt good about him except he kept asking for things that I had already sent in with Cory. That was a drag and that was frustrating. It'd be better if they review some prior emails 'cause it's not super easy trying to go back and find something that I had sent them already when I'm working. Things took a little longer than I expected but that's our fault 'cause of credit. Other than that, I was very happy with my rate.

Pam,"Highlands Ranch, CO","Reviewed Sept. 30, 2021","The application process with AmeriSave was awesome. The portal was great and I liked it. It was a wonderful way to keep communications available and keep on track with me and what they needed. I felt secure about everything because it was a portal. The rep was honest and sincere. I would have liked to see the rate a little less but he did the best he could. It’s not a big drop from what I had but he pointed out to me the overall savings from going from a 30-year to a 15-year. So, he was very informative. He wasn't on a commission so my best interests were at the forefront. It was a very easy process with AmeriSave and it was pleasant for me.",5
Garth,"Kingwood, TX","Reviewed Sept. 30, 2021","Refinancing with AmeriSave has been overall really good. But, I don't like their payment deals. I paid a month in advance and it makes it where I can't set up for autopay the next month. Everything went quite well, short of the fact that I didn't expect there'd be any interest drawn out on the first month's payment just because it was a month early. Yet they still went ahead and drew interest out and considered it the November payment. Also, it'd be nice if AmeriSave had a weekly deal where they pulled money out of your account weekly like we had when we were with SunTrust. Other than that, my rep Clint was very helpful. I'd be on trips, and I can send him info and he’d post it for me.",4

Unfortunately, I'm self-employed and I really wish that I had been told upfront that I should apply for the mortgage in my husband's name since he has a normal job and gets a normal W-2.

Other than that, AmeriSave kept me up-to-date as to when the closing was going to happen and when the intermediary was going to come to my house and sign the papers.

I spent $22 to overnight it, out of pocket, to get it to where it needed to be before they were gonna start charging me late fees.

Jeffrey,"Roseville, CA","Reviewed Aug. 24, 2021","Working with AmeriSave was a great experience. I went there with their mortgage home loan program. It was a 30-year mortgage loan. The online application process was great. It saved a lot of time and they were very helpful. It was a smooth process for me and my family. They got my name wrong by the final documentation though. They didn't verify my full name. When they got to title, we had to correct my name. So, that was the crazy part. But the rep was great, perfect and responsive. There wasn't anything I could have asked from him. He was upfront, there were no hidden issues or programs. He also gave me directions and stated what he could and could not do as a loan representative. I was very satisfied.",5
Connie,"Salisbury, MA","Reviewed Aug. 23, 2021","The application process at AmeriSave was seamless. Their reps were great, responsive and also helpful. Because when you're doing anything, refinancing or even going for a mortgage, it's stressful. So, it's nice to be working with people who want to ease that stress, not add to it. Their rates and terms were great too. It was actually better than what I initially had signed on for.",5
Christopher,"Monroe, NC","Reviewed Aug. 23, 2021","I started the application with AmeriSave in the middle of February, and I didn't close the loan until about the middle of July. However, one of the holdups was a seasoning period that I was unaware of when I had started the application. So, it was really no fault of AmeriSave’s. I had lived in the house for several years, but legally, on paperwork, the house had only been in my name for a certain amount of days, and it needed to be either three or six months in my name before the company would allow me to do a refinance.",3
Sheridan,"Dorchester Center, MA","Reviewed Aug. 22, 2021","I spoke to an agent of AmeriSave. He had called saying that he understood I was in the market to refinance. I told him I was in the process of refinancing with someone else and he said, ""Suppose we give you a better deal."" I said, ""Okay, let's see what you can do."" He gave me a better deal and stuck to what he said he would give me, and I gave him some information. It was a good process. I had a few hitches because I had to get stuff that I didn't have and I had to depend on others to send it to me and to send it to them. But otherwise, it went very smoothly. They closed when they said they were going to close and there were no hidden fees. The rates were quite good and I'm happy with them. Everyone that I came into contact with was very helpful, kind and professional, as well.",5
Robert,"Fountain Hills, AZ","Reviewed Aug. 22, 2021","AmeriSave had a little bit cheaper rate and the process went pretty smooth. However, the rep wasn't answering his phone and if you're my point of contact and you don’t answer your phone for a whole weekend, you're blowing me off. I'm in charge of site while working in construction so my phone is on all the time. I don't care what day it is, what holiday it is, my phone is on. If you call me, I will answer it. That's why that bothered me. I was calling and calling and nobody was answering. I was getting pissed off to the point where I almost said, ""Forget it. I'm going somewhere else.” The rep told me he had a personal problem but he could have at least texted me back to let me know he couldn't talk then. But we got through it and overall, it was a good experience.",3
Larry,"Clemmons, NC","Reviewed Aug. 21, 2021",We were not happy with the company that we were with as they did not have or offer a product that we really liked. We wanted to switch over to a fixed loan in which the rates were not competitive. We looked at AmeriSave's reviews and they were very positive. The experience that we had mirrored that. Everything was readily easy and everyone was very professional and cooperative. We always do what we're supposed to do. It was overall enjoyable and that was not an easy thing to say because it took a lot of time with all the information that was required. We're in our mid-60s and we're not computer-savvy people. But we were very pleased. This company does what they say in a timely fashion.,5
Jerry,"Leavenworth, KS","Reviewed Aug. 21, 2021","The application process with AmeriSave was easy and straightforward. It took me eight weeks from start to finish. They answered my questions for me. At one point, there was something that I didn't understand and I thought that I was ready to drop it but the guy was totally patient. He had somebody else call me. By then, I'd already looked into it and realized that I just didn't understand the pre-funding the escrow is what it was. So, I really was pleased with all my interactions with them. I'm also very happy with the rate I wound up with. Everything was upfront. There were no surprises. They told me on the very first conversation, when we went over the terms of the mortgage, every single thing that wound up happening. So I was very pleased with that.",5
Paul,"Jensen Beach, FL","Reviewed Aug. 20, 2021","During the application process with AmeriSave, there was a lot of communication, which was good. I dealt with a gentleman named Larry and he was very informative and knowledgeable. So, that helped out tremendously. The whole process was quick and I’m happy and very satisfied with the terms and the rates. I liked that everything was online and very easy to use. You keep getting notifications every time they need something. So, you'd log in and do what they need you to do. Larry helped with the whole process which streamlined it a lot. This isn't my first rodeo. So, compared to my other experiences, it was very easy.",5
Tony,"Garden Grove, CA","Reviewed Aug. 20, 2021","I was really happy with the rates and the terms we got from AmeriSave. Everything was to our liking. We got a 30-year fixed. We got 2.25%. We had refinanced about a year and a half ago, so it didn't make any difference. We didn't really lose anything by refinancing again. We went from 3.1 to 2.25, which is pretty good. This is our forever home, so that's what we thought at best. I have recommended AmeriSave to several people since it pushed through. The gentleman we worked with was really good. He followed up when he needed to. He was very knowledgeable and got back to us if we had any questions. He was easily accessible through the internet or even a phone call. Everything was online. Things went pretty lickety-split. It was the fastest refinance and the easiest we've ever gone through and we've done it about four times now.",5

If we emailed, within an hour to two hours, she was already emailing back with the answer even during like off-hours. I was unclear of some of the documents and I called her. Then she would walk me through. The only thing that was aggravating was uploading the documents. Sometimes if you didn't have the right document size, and I learned that apparently, my phone was taking too high of a megapixel picture, and it would not upload it. I was getting so frustrated. I liked the rate and terms. They were good. I've already recommended AmeriSave to several people on my same street.",5

Wael,"Edmonds, WA","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2021","AmeriSave had the lowest rate at the time we did the loan but the process took a long time. It was two and a half months to refinance.

When you send an email, they don't reply to you for two, three days.",4
Deborah,"Seldovia, AK","Reviewed Aug. 15, 2021","The process was very fast and efficient, and the rep was great. He kept close contact and he told me I wouldn't regret going with AmeriSave. I’m very satisfied with the rates and terms. I changed my term to 10 years instead of 15 and the increase of the pay is not much higher at all. I'll be fine with those payments because I'm having an evaluation and before the 6th of September, I'm supposed to get a raise, which will help also.",5
Wayne,"Ocala, FL","Reviewed Aug. 14, 2021",We did a refinance and took some equity out of the house.

I'm not that good with cell phones and sending in all the faxes so she walked me through and we got it done. Everything went smoothly on my end. The terms and rates were a lot better than what I had and I'll pay this off quicker. People should go with AmeriSave.,5

I waited a day for answers on some of my questions but that was natural and understandable because they deal with other people as well. I wanted to know everything about the process and I was asking detailed questions regarding many things. I was reading documents and not simply looking at the basic numbers.,5

I preferred email interaction better so, they accommodated that. The rep was good about giving me updates and letting me know what was going on. He helped me a couple of times because we set up my account on the internet and the first one wouldn’t let me go through. So, they had to work with me and set up a separate one, which seemed to be working fine after that. When I had an issue, they responded well. I was very happy with the rate and terms. It was great.",5
Mark,"Huntington, WV","Reviewed Aug. 12, 2021","AmeriSave seemed to be pretty flexible on things while the other banks didn't really want to work with me for some reason. The process was also simplified with them and they had good ratings on the internet. After I filled out an application for a 30-year refinance, they got with me to ask me a bunch of information and I had to send them in. It was a well thought out and easy process. The girl I worked with, Darlene, was really helpful, too. The whole process took about three weeks to a month and I was really happy with it. AmeriSave's reps were efficient and when I needed to contact and ask them questions, they answered my questions really quickly. I also got my loan refinanced at a lower rate and got a lower payment. All in all, anyone who wants to refinance or get a regular loan should look into AmeriSave. Working with them helped me make my mortgage payment easier each month and pay my other bills off quicker since my mortgage is lower.",5
John,"Venice, FL","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2021","AmeriSave is fantastic. I gave them a chance to quote, and they were super friendly and easy to work with. They were also very good with being upfront about the fees. Applying with them took three weeks and everything was very simple and very easy. I wish I could get a hold of them now though. My first mortgage payment was due on the 1st and when my loan was sold, I don't have the information on who to make my payment to. So by the 5th, I'm going to be late. I've called them twice and left voicemails. When you call their 800 number, option number 4 is to arrange for payment. It'll ring and ring, then it gives you a voicemail and says leave a message and somebody will call you back. But nobody has and it's mind blowing. So, I didn't make my first mortgage payment and I don't know how to make it. Other than that, this is my second loan with AmeriSave and I've got no issues with them.",5

Sheri,"Spokane, MO","Reviewed Aug. 11, 2021","I put in a thing on the internet and AmeriSave was the first people to call. Also, among the couple of people who gave me quotes, they gave me the best quote. So, I went with them. The guy that I worked with was Thomas and he did his best to help me and give me the best rate. But we thought my house would appraise at 200,000 and it was a little less. That was because the house wasn't what we thought it would be. The thing that that I wasn't very happy with is the people that AmeriSave sent out to appraise the house. I'm sure they worked for them, but I just didn't agree with their quote on my property. I don't know if we could have changed that, but maybe researched better or get two different people but I would have liked to have known ahead of time. So, the first timeframe was over six to eight months and it was delayed by quite some time. But part of it was due to COVID. We had to restart the process over when I did some home improvements and got my debt ratio down due to the increase in value in the house. The second time, when we went through it all, it went really fast.",4
Clint,"Conway, SC","Reviewed Aug. 10, 2021","I hadn’t made up my mind to go. But when the rep started giving me the information that I asked, he had the answers. They didn't seem like rehearsals. It didn't sound like somebody was reading off a script to me. That’s the biggest thing for me. It sounded like a sincere-- it was like you weren’t talking to somebody who had been trained on every little thing to say to punch the buttons. The guy who did it made the sale for AmeriSave. I got to checking AmeriSave after I talked with him. After the whole process, I’d be much more ready to recommend AmeriSave. Everybody that worked with them, there was so much cooperation. It seemed like they had a good thing. It just seemed like they were giving out good information, and they were legitimately trying to help me get what I needed the most. And I was impressed.

But other people in the AmeriSave office kept butting in and sending me emails and texts that we needed the information, which we didn't really need. That part of it was very confusing.

But then I would get an email from AmeriSave, and they still were requesting the same documents that I put in. So it makes me wonder if they ever get my documents at all? I would have to call the loan processor or the loan originator to say, “Did you ever get the documents that you requested three or four days ago? And I sent them and then you’re still requesting them?” So that was a little nerve-wracking because I never know if they received it or not. But other than that, I'm happy they were able to do it.

Emmalinda,"Leesburg, VA","Reviewed Aug. 6, 2021","My sister had refinanced her home with AmeriSave and had a good experience. So I got referred from her.

Because I had refinanced originally and my appraisal did not come back to what it was supposed to be. But I was still charged the $500 application fee, which I had to fight over it. But I got it back. Normally, they don't. And if I didn't fight for it, I probably would not have gotten it back. That is one thing that they should change because other lenders do not charge that. Other than that, the rep was very knowledgeable, very helpful, knew exactly what she was doing, and made the process easy.

Everything went very smoothly. The first person I talked to was very helpful, and took the lead through the process. The rate was certainly competitive.",5
Sabrina,"Gardnerville, NV","Reviewed July 31, 2021","We are so glad a friend recommended checking out AmeriSave for our refi! Allison was amazing. Any questions we had, she was there with a response in no time. We started the process, got all the required documents emailed and within 2 weeks we were signing closing papers. Can't rave about our experience enough!",5
Michael,"Lakeville, MN","Reviewed July 31, 2021","Amerisave offered the best rate and terms by a significant margin. That's why I picked them. I was lucky and got a great agent, but the PROCESS was HORRIBLE! They asked for far more supporting data than other Mortgagers, and made some frankly completely outrageous requests. I was always told ""The Underwriters"" needed yet more data, and the process would stop. One example: They asked for an official May 2021 Bank Statement showing sufficient closing funds....on May 19!! They wanted an ""official"" statement 12 days before the month was even over! AND THEY HELD UP THE MORTGAGE BECAUSE OF IT!! 2nd example: I had fully paid-for vacant land as an asset, and again the Mortgage was held up....due to the lots being referred to as **, and **. They would not accept ZERO as an address, when all the lot, plot, tax, and other info tied it all together.",2
Artem,"Sanger, CA","Reviewed July 31, 2021","Any online application is not as personable as doing it with a person, so I wasn't too thrilled about that part of the process with AmeriSave. I was more thrilled about the gentleman who helped me out with my refinance. His name was Mark and he was very pleasant. He was very on top of it and he was very nice as far as anything I needed. I could call him anytime and he was available, which was amazing. The rates and terms they gave me were very good, too.",5
Pinkesh,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed July 31, 2021","I got AmeriSave's information through a close friend. There was Ryan. One of my friends used him to refinance his home. That's why he sent me the information. I talked to him and went from there. I paid July rent, and then I got a form that I filled out that said to set up automatic payment. I sent it in a while ago. It has been a few weeks. So, I don't know if for this month it’s gonna deduct automatically or do I need to send another check. Because it sends those monthly statements automatically, so I wanted to check. But as far as the service that AmeriSave has provided so far, it has been good.",5

They did a Refi & Cash out during a Pandemic .... Thanks, Nick Z.",5
Carey,"Bardwell, KY","Reviewed July 30, 2021","From the first Phone call to the last, I never had a single issue. All my questions were answered. The whole process was simple and easy and moved along quick. I highly recommend this company if you are interested in A loan or refinance project.",5
Linda,"Petaluma, CA","Reviewed July 30, 2021",I recently refinanced my home. Amerisave had the best rates and Kathrine ** was great to work with. I would recommend this company to others. I would use them again if I needed anything more if their rates were still lowest.,5
Pierre,"Moreno Valley, CA","Reviewed July 30, 2021","Jeffrey ** worked on our Refi from Amerisave, He was the greatest, very professional, walked it through with us so we can understand everything to our satisfaction, called us even when he didn't have to, just to see how we were doing, do we have any questions, etc., letting us know everything looking good, I believe it only took 34 day in escrow to close,...

Jeanne,"Sanford, NC","Reviewed July 30, 2021",Alexis was easy to work with and was on top of everything every step of the way. She was careful to follow up with questions and all contacts (like title company) to be sure nothing was missed. Closing was swift and easy.,5
Linda,"Oakhurst, CA","Reviewed July 30, 2021","I first submitted a request through LendingTree, and I was contacted by multiple lenders. I ended up going with AmeriSave because I liked the gentleman that I was working with. He was pleasant and efficient. I also got a better offer from another lender, so I presented that offer to AmeriSave and they matched it. Everything went really well and it was a very easy process. Online, we submitted everything quickly, because I was able to see what they needed. When I'd call the rep (Robert) anytime I had a question, he'd get back to me almost immediately. The only thing that could improve is after the application process was done, when it was turned over to the next step through underwriting then into the finalizing the loan process, the communication was not very good.",5
Frankee,"Columbus, OH","Reviewed July 30, 2021","When I started depositing with AmeriSave, they just did everything electronically. And I did not have to provide them with any documents except one addendum to the sales contract extending the date from our original contract, because the date was coming up. It would fall short of expiring before we would close. In that respect, it was so easy, it seemed like, after what had gone on with Bank of America that I wasn't even 100% sure that we would close. On the other hand, everyone I worked with in AmeriSave was helpful. Ariel, the processor, kept me informed on everything along the way.",5
Glenn,"Durham, NC","Reviewed July 29, 2021",Absolutely the best mortgage company to work with. The process was very smooth. If I had questions I simply emailed them and was given a response very quickly. If the need should arise for a new mortgage or refinance Amerisave would be the one to call.,5
Don,"Mitchell, IN","Reviewed July 29, 2021",Nolan ** was very helpful and attentive with the loan. No complaints with anyone. There is one post loan problem and that is my wife is not shown as a loan co-borrower on the paperwork filed with the Property tax Assessor at the Lawrence County Indiana Court office. I reached out to Solidifi and they said it is an AmeriSave document. Still waiting for this to be corrected.,4
Cat,"Bushkill, PA","Reviewed July 29, 2021",This was the most simple refi process I ever went through. Everything was done through online portal which sped up the process. From start to closing...about 6 weeks (amazing). New rate blew away the one I had with JP Morgan Chase (Woke). Always received prompt reply to questions and AmeriSave really understands the mortgage market and your individual needs.,5
Yvonne,"San Diego, CA","Reviewed July 29, 2021","Our experience was very very positive. We worked with Steven ** & Nana **!

Dwight,"Stone Mountain, GA","Reviewed July 29, 2021",It took six months to refi. Other than Steve the company was not responsive to most of my inquiries on progress. Should have moved on but had too much of my time invested. Ultimately I have a satisfactory result. Thank you.,3
Rolando,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed July 29, 2021",Amerisave was a great experience for my refinance. The consultant was very knowledgeable and everything went very smoothly.

Hsuei-Shian,"Fremont, CA","Reviewed July 29, 2021","My first home was refinanced by Amerisave. On my first try, the team that processed my refinancing on my first home took 69 days, so I quit as I was very unhappy. One month later, I refinanced my first home with another team at Amerisave. This team completed the whole processed in less than three weeks. I was satisfied.",3
Andrew,"Dundee, OR","Reviewed July 29, 2021","Amerisave has an automated process of documentation that streamlines the process, particularly in light of COVID restrictions, and made it really convenient to process my request. Everything from the web portal to submit docs to the signing process was very efficient and when a phone call was required for clarification and Q&A, it occurred in a timely manner and they were pleasant, throughout. I got a good rate and would recommend them to anyone interested in taking advantage of the historic low interest rates we are experiencing--I am a happy client!!",5
Amber,"Gilbert, AZ","Reviewed July 29, 2021",We refinanced our home twice with AmeriSave and plan to use them to purchase our next home as well. The process has always been quick and efficient service every time. I love that I can do everything electronically as well.,5
Edward,"Scottsdale, AZ","Reviewed July 29, 2021","To me, the most impressive thing about AmeriSave is that they were pretty much hassle free from the initial application, to the closing of the loan...and then to starting to make the monthly payments. In this day and age, it's rare that one has this kind of experience with customer service at any company. Hassle free is always a good thing!",5
Prashant,"Norfolk, MA","Reviewed July 29, 2021","Have had above average experience at the time of the refinance process. Perhaps, pro support sucks. Their support team when you need help are NOT responsive at all. I've had a property tax issue through the escrow. They didn't pay tax from the escrow amount. Warrant was issued because of that. I made many attempts (1st week and 3rd week and following week) to pay off the balance. Did not pay the amount to the correct location. Instead, I ended up paying off of my pocket to save my TITLE. They keep on disconnecting my phone or holding me on the phone for so long for no reason. Almost 7+ weeks while writing this review, NO RESPONSE or a single update from the team whatsoever. No direct call to the escrow team or manager or others when you need them. Totally disaster. I want company executives to take action against those not doing their job. If execs are not doing their job then I have no words.",1
Nicholas,"Naples, FL","Reviewed July 29, 2021","My mortgage company was fine, but I wanted to save money. I called somebody and when I got that ball rolling, somebody else called. AmeriSave was going to do 2.99, while the other place was going to do 3.125. I called the other place and said. “Hey, they're going to give me 2.99. I'm going to go with them unless you can match it.” “Well, we can't match it.” “Okay. Goodbye.” I went with AmeriSave, and the process was really smooth, to be able to do everything to refinance my mortgage online or just through talking to the phone. AmeriSave was great. The guy, Jamie, that I spoke back and forth to was great as well. Anything that was an issue was on my end. Now, I have a lower interest rate and a lower monthly cost.",5
Andrea,"Simi Valley, CA","Reviewed July 29, 2021","AmeriSave was prompt, very responsive, and answered all my questions. I'm happy that it's all done. It has been very beneficial on both ends that we were able to borrow money from our home and pay things off, especially with the COVID-19 has been a disruption for us. And then also within that, they were able to ensure that our payments were not increased. So that made it a bit easier for us also. The communication was wonderful. The one negative thing I found is that I had to continue to provide information. The same request was coming through, so the certificate was duplicate. The process was already too long. It took forever. And then having the request of duplicate information just made it even longer. But overall, they did a wonderful job and were always professional.",4
Johnny & Connie,"Oklahoma City, OK","Reviewed July 28, 2021",We were perfectly happy with AmeriSave. The reps were sensible. We texted back and forth. We were hoping for another half percent be removed. But it’s good and it has helped us out. They worked with us in every way and made an effort to meet our needs. And I feel they do the same for everybody. We tried to get our son to call them.,5
Raymond,"Pueblo West, CO","Reviewed July 27, 2021","I had Wells Fargo, but then I got a call from Rocco and I heard him out. I got 20 other calls from other companies, but I decided to go with Rocco. I felt comfortable, and I'm happy with the rates and terms that I got. When we initially did it though, Rocco told me there wouldn't be anything out of pocket at closing besides the application fee, but when everything was said and done, there was $1,000 for closing. I asked him about it and he said, ""Well, I did tell you there wouldn't be."" He made sure it got fixed. He talked to whoever the heck he talked to and it made the 1,000 bucks go away.",5
Rafael,"Greenville, SC","Reviewed July 27, 2021","At the last minute of the process, AmeriSave started asking for stuff that should have been done and I was a little bit frustrated. There was a lot of unnecessary stuff and a lot of delaying for no reason because they couldn't figure something out with the FHA. That took another two days. I took days off to be ready for what they wanted me to have. I went through almost three weeks of hell. They told me, “We’re closing today.” But they were reviewing the entire day. They said there was one last thing. But another thing pops up then another. Me telling my job I was gonna take the day off because I was closing with something caused me to lose three days of my vacation time. ",3

Natasha,"Goshen, KY","Reviewed July 26, 2021","AmeriSave's process was very quick and easy. I'm a single parent and I work full time so I enjoyed the online process. I did their a FHA conventional loan and it was a fixed one. The rate was very low at the time. My rep was great and we communicated via house phone and email. In terms of response time, they were very quick to answer any questions I had. I would give anyone interested my rep's name and number and have them reach out to AmeriSave.",5
Jose,"Wilmington, CA","Reviewed July 25, 2021","I felt very comfortable once I talked to the rep because I had worked with him before. Once he got in touch with me and I started talking to him, I was like, “Yes.” I feel so relieved and I felt comfortable to do it again. The process was very simple. The rep was very helpful and truthful. And whatever he said he would get or do, it was done the way he explained it to me. It was very professional. Once he was done with his part, he gave me to the underwriter. And they took over and verified everything. Everything went smoothly. I don't like to be misled or for somebody to tell me they can do it nd then tell me that they can't. AmeriSave had some questions about some other properties I have. They understood and did everything. They have done a lot for my life. Economically, it has been great.",5
Charles,"Lynchburg, VA","Reviewed July 25, 2021","We found during our search that all the interest rates of the companies were comparable. But AmeriSave had the best customer service hands down. They actually cared and it wasn't just about money even if at the end of the day, it really was. They took the time to keep checking in with us weekly and asking if there was anything that they could help us with. They let us know that everything was still on and they were just waiting for this or that approval. Our initial contact was Yvonne and she was phenomenal.",5
Aswad,"Holbrook, MA","Reviewed July 24, 2021",AmeriSave offered a more upfront experience of understanding what we were getting into from a cost and rate perspective versus the other lenders we were looking at. The rep returned our calls and emails with a quick turnaround. Everyone in the organization was helpful when we ran into any issues. Everything went smoothly. They were quicker than the other ones we were looking at who tried to push us out about two months. They were receptive and understanding. They gave us the refi we were looking for.,5
Carolyn,"Romeoville, IL","Reviewed July 24, 2021","I worked with a rep in Georgia and I had a very good experience. Everything was okay.

William,"Naples, FL","Reviewed July 23, 2021","AmeriSave had the best rate at the time. Also, everybody was very helpful. They worked with me, made sure I was able to accelerate my close date.

Christopher,"Aiken, SC","Reviewed July 22, 2021","Their reps worked with each other as well as with us and anytime we needed help, they were right there. But the website could give more explanation of what to do and be more user-friendly. Also, there seemed like a lot of paperwork. We didn't know what some terms meant but when we had questions, they got back to us. Overall, we had a good outcome. We've saved money and we're able to enjoy life a little bit more. We're with a lot lower interest rate so, in the long run, we're gonna save a lot more money too.",5
Brett,"Placentia, CA","Reviewed July 21, 2021","I worked with AmeriSave before. It was a great company to work with. It has been a good company for me. The process was streamlined. Darla was really helpful and kind. She took the time, answered all my phone calls, and was very professional.",5
Patrick,"Seneca, SC","Reviewed July 21, 2021","The lady I was dealing with at AmeriSave was great to deal with. She was very personable and if I had a question, she responded back to me in minutes. The application to closing took a little longer than expected. The issue was with the time it took for the appraiser to get to us and get the report back. The appraiser and company need to be a little bit more responsive.",5
Corey,"Stockton, CA","Reviewed July 20, 2021","I started searching for lenders and AmeriSave seemed like the ones that were on top of it. They were reaching out to me and they were giving me good and competitive rates. It seemed like they were the most likely to get it done quickly. I did a refinance with some cash-out and it was something that I wanted to get done quickly. The online application process went really smoothly and the rep, Sara, was always there when I needed her. She was proactive and reached out to me to ask if I needed anything. There were a couple of things that weren't exactly how they said, like the document signing. I thought it was going to be e-signed but the people keeping track of the paperwork didn't allow that. But I wanted to get a loan where I wouldn't have to have my house inspected and AmeriSave was good at that.",5
Todd,"Millbury, MA","Reviewed July 20, 2021","Everything I needed, AmeriSave would spend as much time on the phone as needed to get it straightened out.

Yasmine called me right back and waited for the process. They were very clear. I had some concern. They were so quick and fast. I was like, ""Is this a real company or not?"" The application process is better than most. Go through all the information, it was collected. And it went well with whenever it needed to pull in my income information, so it was great. When you upload documents, sometimes it keeps asking for the same stuff even after you upload it. But it wasn't that big of a deal. Overall, it's almost better than Rocket Mortgage because I went through the same process. It's also better than Caliber Mortgage.",5
Ashley,"Wetumpka, AL","Reviewed July 14, 2021","AmeriSave Mortgage refinanced the lighthouse that we had before so we had used the same guy, JR. He communicated a lot with my husband and gave him the best deal he could. He didn't ghost him or take forever to return calls. We also liked the way the lady came out and let us sign all the documents at our house. That was very convenient especially with our busy schedules. But what seemed kind of frustrating at the end was the documentation that we had to provide. It seemed kind of unclear. I work in pharma, and they bought and sold and bought and sold companies. So, my W2s and other documents were kind of odd. AmeriSave was asking for certain things and we provided them. Then they would say, ""That's not good enough. Do it again.” The description of what we provided needed to be a little bit more clear. That would have helped us. But we were pleased with the experience. We know that the process that was difficult for us probably would have happened anywhere.",5
Carlos,"Clearwater, FL","Reviewed July 11, 2021","The initial contact was really rough because the people that I was dealing with were either quitting or getting promoted so my file got left. But then the woman that took over it did everything positively. She was very apologetic that it got left behind. After that, it was great. She was above and beyond. AmeriSave needs to put in some fail-safes for passing and knowing what files are happening in between, for those situations when either somebody quits or gets let go, to ensure that the files get picked up.",5
Amanda,"Riverside, CA","Reviewed July 10, 2021","The gentleman that helped me was super nice and upfront. He contacted me and walked me through the whole process. He made it really easy for me. He was an amazing guy to work with. He continued to call and check on me, making sure I got everything I needed. If I was confused on the document, he made sure to clarify what it was I needed. He even called my insurance to get a document that they weren't sending correctly. So I was really, really, really happy with his service. Also, the rate that I got was a lot lower than I got from the previous mortgage. I got back more money than I would have at the other place.",5

I reached back out to Darius and he kind of took over from there. Darius is the one who pretty much did everything. I liked him. I reached out to him yesterday about doing another refinance.,5
Matthew,"Rockwall, TX","Reviewed July 6, 2021","The officer I worked with at AmeriSave was knowledgeable, honest, and helpful. Also, he was really responsive in communication.

Calvin,"Mansfield, TX","Reviewed July 5, 2021","AmeriSave had a better deal than the other companies and their interest rate was better too. However, there was this one guy who wasted my time. He made me believe everything was okay. I did everything I had to do then I was waiting but nothing was happening. I called the main office and that was where they assigned my case to somebody else. My application had to be restarted from scratch after three months with a new agent and that's where everything was fine.",4
Joseph,"Holly Springs, NC","Reviewed July 4, 2021",I wanted to refi with cash out and Amerisave was one of the few ones that was offering a cash out. They were very responsive. The rate was lower which was good and I was able to get cash out on top of that. It was a very positive experience.,5

It was a smooth experience and I would definitely recommend them.",5
Penny,"Novi, MI","Reviewed July 2, 2021","I liked how quickly AmeriSave answered my questions. They immediately called me when I requested to apply and they contacted me by phone. After that, it was almost all online. And if I had a question, it was immediately answered. They were very informative and I had options, according to points, to be paid.

Then, the agent from AmeriSave got right back to me and said that she would speak to me that night. I went with them because of that, plus, they gave me the best rate. I went on to AmeriSave's website and had to submit documents that way if they were needed. They approved the application and I had to eSign a bunch of things. Then we did a hybrid close and someone showed up to our house to do the final closing documents, which took 30 minutes. The whole process was great and took a month to complete. The rep I had was really good, too. Her name was Rachel and I recommend her. Everybody at AmeriSave was really easy to work with and if I had a question, I would email and they'd get right back to me.",5
Kelsie,"Noblesville, IN","Reviewed June 28, 2021","They were very forward with information and making sure they explained things to me through the process so that, I wasn't caught off guard by any of the numbers once we started the paperwork. Brad specifically was very fun to work with because he made it entertaining, which is hard to find with somebody over the phone. He made sure that he had conversations about those things that benefit us. While we had downtime, he made it still an interesting conversation instead of letting us sit there in silence. So it was really nice. I was really happy with the final rate because I was expecting it to be more with the amount that we'd take out. We got a really good deal out of everything, and Brad helped us out. ",5

The officer that was handling my loan for refinancing was really quick and straightforward. Everything was online. I wish I had a little bit more follow-up on like how to pay for the first mortgage. Other than that, Sandy was very communicative. She has a very enthusiastic personality. She seemed like she wanted to help you out. She wasn’t just, “I'm just doing this ‘cause it's my job.” She did a great job from beginning to end of the loan. If she needed something, she had her assistant reach out to me. If I had any difficulties with uploading documents, I could either contact her via email or phone. So, that was really nice. I was very comfortable working with AmeriSave. I'd do it again.",5
John,"Leander, TX","Reviewed June 27, 2021","The communication was great. They would email and call me. I could call them and ask questions, and they would get right back to me. I worked with Joseph and he did great. He explained everything to me. The loan application was great. It's just toward the end where it kinda started lacking on stuff. The online stuff was all fine. It was pretty easy to deal with. It was all straightforward. Everything seemed to work all right. The part I did not like was the title company that they used. They were out of state and I ended up having to do a lot of the work myself.",5
Monte,"Overland Park, KS","Reviewed June 26, 2021",Amerisave cannot seem to be able to process change of address requests. We have sent two requests to change the address from our Florida condo rental to our home which we refinanced with Amerisave. In early June we again called Amerisave about not receiving monthly statements. She admitted there was a change of address in the records but not processed. She agreed to process the change and finally send a monthly statement. It is June 26 and no statement has arrived.,1
Giovanni,"Brookhaven, GA","Reviewed June 26, 2021","The entire process was fast and professional. It was simple and streamlined. Nicholas was very good. In the past, I worked with other loan officers and they were able to take decisions by themself. But Nicholas doesn't. He needs to go to a supervisor. But he was a super hardworking guy and always willing to help.",5
Aleeta,"Brandon, MS","Reviewed June 26, 2021","I did a mortgage on my house because my ambition was to get the interest rate dropped down and I paid points to get the rate I wanted. My finances aren't exactly simple and the AmeriSave reps were very good to be patient and yet prodding to get all the information that was needed and they were easy to communicate with and always very cordial. I talked to three companies. The bank, of course was horrid, where I've always had my mortgages. But I talked to a couple of others. They also had nice people, but they couldn't put the package that I wanted together. I am looking at retirement, and so having that interest rate lowered to drop the monthly payments was my ambition.",5
Christi,"Baldwyn, MS","Reviewed June 25, 2021","The application process was very easy to fill out online. But the whole process took a little longer than normal. It was probably because I was sending the information to the person that was working with me, and he would upload it. I didn’t directly upload it here. We almost reached the time limit, where we had to start it all over. But the two guys that I worked with were absolutely fabulous. I would call them on a Sunday and they'd call me back. A gentleman that used to be a coach here in the local area came and he closed the loan at my desk and it took about 15 minutes. I signed more papers than there is with Quicken Loans, but I didn’t mind. It was a very pleasant experience.",5
Hydar,"Roseville, CA","Reviewed June 25, 2021","I went online and AmeriSave had the highest rating of all the refinance lenders out there. I worked with Alyssa. She was pretty efficient and very responsive. The only thing is I had the time for the notary to come out, and they postponed it that day for a later time. I had to reach out to find out what was going on and it seemed like Alyssa was out of the loop on that. But the minute she found that, she re-engaged everybody and we set up a signing date, which happened to be on the same day that my property taxes were due. So, I'm hoping the distribution of funds to the local county here for the property taxes went out in time. Otherwise, it would have been fine.",5
Jibril,"Buford, GA","Reviewed June 24, 2021","A few years ago, I had a real estate agent who recommended AmeriSave. I bought a house from them at that point. They were the first lender I turned to. It was the easiest and worry-free process. I did everything through the computer online. They explained to me exactly what was going to happen, worked me through the process, and everything happened as they said and they kept me informed along the way. The application took 30 minutes or less. Then the underwriting took a week because they were waiting on me for some documentation to get cleared. I have not seen one lender that can move as fast as AmeriSave that is really on top of things and is working to get everything closed for me. I'm totally satisfied.",5
Cathy,"Torrance, CA","Reviewed June 24, 2021","I reached out to a couple of lenders and AmeriSave had the best rate. The reps were very responsive. They always picked up the phone. They called me anytime I needed something. There was a bit of confusion once because I sent something online and they haven't checked their emails, but it got resolved quickly. They made the process easy for me. And it was fast. I had some questions because I didn't understand the process and there was some terms I didn't understand. They were super helpful, accommodating, and a really nice team.",5
L.,"Pa, PA","Reviewed June 23, 2021","My wife looked for decent rates through the computer, and then it came across AmeriSave. So, it seemed it had the best rate. She filled out the online application and she was satisfied. She had a main contact for the refinance, and she was able to communicate with that person on a regular basis. There was a little issue with some of the computer storage of information and documents, and they weren't showing up on our end. And we had to keep going back and forth to get the thing straightened out. But in the end, it all worked out. We were satisfied with the rate and terms at the time. The rates dropped a bit afterwards, but we were still happy with it.",4
Debra,"Spokane, WA","Reviewed June 23, 2021","The process went well once the bumps went away. It was just something random with a staffing change and our paperwork got screwed up. So, ours took about six months. The guy that originally did our loan over the phone with us left the company. And our loan did not get moved. He didn't do a good job and he wrote our whole loan up wrong. And we wouldn't ever qualify for a loan. So, AmeriSave had to start from square one. Once they got us to Jeremy, it was smooth sailing. It was eight weeks and the loan was done. He had a lot of stuff he had to fix. But he always answered the phone, called us back and answered our emails. Also, our rates and terms are exactly what we wanted. Specifically request Jeremy to answer.",5
John,"Madison, TN","Reviewed June 22, 2021","I wanted a mortgage on my house. I own my house outright. I wanted to take some cash out to do some repairs. A lot of times AmeriSave asked me two or three times the same question. So, I don't know what the story was with that, or they weren't communicating with one another or what. Also, I wanted to see a rate of zero, but I didn't see that. So, I did the best I could. They could also drop 90 payments off my bill. Other than that, the guy that handled my mortgage was very good. He was very nice, friendly, and answered whatever questions I had.",5
Joe,"Monticello, IN","Reviewed June 22, 2021","AmeriSave came up with a good plan right off the bat and I thought, ""To hell with it. I'm not gonna waste my time anymore."" So, that's why I went with it. Candice was the biggest part of my contact all the time. She was super on everything. She was the best person that I've ever dealt with in the real estate market. She helped do a lot of things like doing everything online, on the phone, which I was not up on, and she helped me get through that. She constantly called me whatever she did to make sure we've done this or that.",5
Stanvee,"Baltimore, MD","Reviewed June 21, 2021","The process was simple in the beginning and then got complicated in the middle, because some people didn't do what they had to. But overall, I would do the entire process again. It was stressful, but it turned out beautifully and worth every second of it. I’m the type that crosses every T and dots every I. So even where there were inadequacies, it wasn't complicated for me. I just had to do more sort of footwork. I'm thinking of going through a conventional loan next time in the near future with AmeriSave again. Erica was amazing and Sarah was a doll. They were kinda streaming through the process. But at some point, the ball dropped, and Megan rushed in out of nowhere and saved the day. She carried the baton, came back, and followed through. She called back to make sure I was comfortable. She also called me on closing to make sure I ate that day because it was really bad at the end. Megan was the one that really pulled it together.",5
Leeneka,"Rahway, NJ","Reviewed June 21, 2021","I liked the simplicity of the breakdown and transparency. It's very noble if an organization can tell you straight upfront like, ""Hey, this is the best that I can do. This is what we can do,"" and is willing to work with you and didn't look for me to circumvent myself. As far as whether 5%, 10%, 20%, I didn't feel pressured to put more hard cash on the line for sacrificing of a rate. And to know that the rate availabilities given this time, that they fluctuate, they were willing to say, ""Hey, let's try to lock it in. This is the best number we can do. Don't sacrifice another 5, 10 grand to just get dollars to the cents."" That transparency was great. The guidance and the multiple departments that worked in sync with each other. So, there was no lag time in between me filling out the documentation online.",5
Guillermo,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed June 20, 2021","The process of obtaining the mortgage with AmeriSave was excellent. I had a pretty tight schedule when I initiated the process and I had to go for a couple of months and my rate was held until I come back. I was pretty satisfied. With this pandemic situation, using the DocuSign was pretty good. The person that came over that did a hybrid closing was pretty knowledgeable. Everybody seemed to know what they were doing. Everything worked fine, except that I didn't know if I'm supposed to get a whole package of documents signed because I had some signed by DocuSign and then there were some that I signed personally. It was a pretty good experience since it was done mostly by DocuSign.",5
Scott,"Cumming, GA","Reviewed June 20, 2021","I submitted a request through Bankrate.com and AmeriSave was one of the companies that responded back.

He responded back to any questions I had quickly.",5
Brandon,"Missouri City, TX","Reviewed June 19, 2021","We shopped at three different companies looking at different rates, and AmeriSave had the best rate.

Naylesh,"San Antonio, TX","Reviewed June 17, 2021","Christian called me then we submitted documents. The process was easy and didn't take too long. The application process did not last more than 45 days. When I first talked to Christian, he told me they would close in 45 days, so he kept his word and that’s the one thing I’m proud about. But it was hard to communicate with the agent. They call you every week, but when you need them, you just have to email them to contact. Then they would respond about the next day. Other than that, they are better than Wells Fargo. I did it with Wells Fargo before and AmeriSave is quicker. It was also more comfortable working with them than going with other banks.",5
Robert,"Barre, VT","Reviewed June 17, 2021","I got a conventional 30-year fixed rate loan through AmeriSave Mortgage. It was pretty easy. Everything went pretty smooth. The rates were good.

The originating agent was very knowledgeable and very conscientious with great follow-through, and the process was easy.",5
Steven,"Mission Viejo, CA","Reviewed June 10, 2021","I applied for a refinance. I easily qualified and have in excess of 50% equity, it should have been a slam dunk. I spent the next seven months sending in excess of 100 documents, many multiple times. The requests would come in every week or two, it was ultimately a stall tactic. I reached out to customer service many times. I even received closing disclosures with rate lock and closing dates but they were never hit and eventually they came back with a rate an eighth percent higher than the closing I agreed to and had locked at one point. There is no excuse for this type of incompetence. This cost me thousands of dollars and endless frustration. The customer service was also terrible. They never had any information on what was happening, I heard we are reviewing documents internally a dozen times and could never get a ETA on my closing other than what was in the disclosure which had my hopes up but ultimately was a lie.",1
Albert,"Mount Pleasant, SC","Reviewed May 25, 2021",I inquired on the internet at AmeriSave about refinancing my house. A representative call me back and before we hung up I had a set percentage rate secured. After that it was just providing them with paperwork they requested and shortly afterwards I was notified of the closing date. The people were very polite and professional and kept me informed during the process. The personnel are very professional.,5
Irene,"Ely, IA","Reviewed May 25, 2021","I was happy with how the process went through. It took 45 days but it was not because AmeriSave was not doing their part. Everybody was helpful. It was more because of my bank not releasing information. I was really happy with the way AmeriSave handled things, the professionalism, their feedback, and their return calls. The only thing I have right now is that I want to make automatic payments from my account to AmeriSave. I haven't received any coupons though. I'm going to use the temporary coupons I got from the packet to make my first payment. Other than that, I don't know what I'm going to get or how I can do that. Overall, everything was good. I even got two people to call Carlos because they were first-time home-buying. He was the one that I connected to the most.",5
Derrick,"Plaistow, NH","Reviewed May 25, 2021","I saw on the reviews that somebody gave a downside because AmeriSave didn't work on the weekend, but I did not experience that at all. Wesley called me on a weekend, spoke to me, and said if I had any questions, to call back. Sometimes he is away, but he said that if he doesn't answer right away then he’ll give me a callback. The application process was smooth and easy and the rates and terms were exactly what we were looking for. It was explained to us that the option of decreasing in the rate was there, but we didn't want to decrease so much. We were more seeking about taking out the cash so we could do more repairs to the home.",5
William,"Buckeye, AZ","Reviewed May 24, 2021",We had a wonderful experience with AmeriSave. Spencer D. helped to move our refinance loan forward in record time. We closed in just under 30 days!

The issue is that they said that the appraisal came back less than it did 14 months ago. The crazy part is my property taxes increased. It is hard to try to do business with people who continue to try to insult your intelligence just because of our race and our age. I spoke to Mary **, Shevawn **, and their supervisor Gage. All I ever asked them to do is just be upfront with us and not try to say what they think we wanted to hear. ",1

Michelle,"Lowell, MI","Reviewed May 22, 2021",We were looking for a cash out refinance and took a chance on Amerisave. Rates were competitive. The process began in early April. We needed to upload a lot of documents and sometimes the site didn't seem to be working. Every request we received we quickly responded to. My husband has a good income and is self employed. He has been for over 10 years so we have a good history of income. Amerisave kept asking for more information related to his self employment. The message we kept getting was 'Please provide documentation verifying your self-employed business is currently operating.' We would send more info then it would pop up again.,1
Mike,"Philadelphia, PA","Reviewed May 22, 2021","I worked with AmeriSave to do refinancing and changing the terms on the loan. I like the online application. I like that I have access to the documents. The only problem is sometimes they ask you different things that it was nothing to do with my application, like something about me paying for child alimony and divorce. But I got divorced 25 years ago. So there were different things that didn't really make sense and the answer the guy had for me was only he was just following the system. AmeriSave dragged the process for more than they were supposed to. But in the end of it, everything worked out. I'm happy because in the end, they gave me what I wanted.",4

We happened to call the agent, and he sounded very knowledgeable and friendly. There's also so many companies out there, especially Quicken Loans, that badger you.

Ion,"Livonia, MI","Reviewed May 20, 2021","Because I'm self-employed, the mortgage company didn't want to deal with me. They asked a lot of things twice or thrice. The process is not the easiest one and could be way better. The best thing was this guy who guided us through the whole thing. I am self-employed and it was a pain in order for me to give them all the documents. Let’s say they asked for profit or loss for two years then they asked for profit or loss for one year, but I already gave them the one for the two years. Things like this are useless, but all over, rate was okay. Their rep was the best guy I met too. That's why I stayed with them.",4

We talked on the phone and she answered my questions correctly and quickly. Their online application process was the one part that I didn't love, but it was straightforward and easy. I would just prefer to work with their actual person from the beginning. Because of where I live being a very rural location, it was hard to find an appraiser.

Things concerning my divorce from 20 years ago. I happened to have it. It could have closed down the whole thing, having to do with my divorce settlement, even though the property was in my name only.

I was kind of committed to going through with my first lender and I was very open with him that they need to do better. He was really good about taking that and changing my mind.

AmeriSave did a great job and got my loan closed in a timely fashion. Once we got approved and everything was submitted, it got in their title department and that was the only part that took a little while. But it may not have been AmeriSave's fault. It was probably the contract person they were using. AmeriSave had a good rate as well as customer service and their closing costs were more affordable than some other lenders that you have options to choose from.",5
Judith,"Miami, FL","Reviewed May 13, 2021","Applying online with AmeriSave was simple and the whole process took a couple months to get done. The person that I was always in communication with was Jason and he always kept me informed on what was next. He always answered all my questions and I was pretty comfortable working with him. We communicated through email and at times, if we needed to have a phone conversation, he called me and it was never a problem. The rate they gave me is also lower than my previous rate, so I'm satisfied. All in all, they were great to work with and they have a website that you can go to and upload documents that makes the process very convenient.",5
Rebecca,"Piedmont, OK","Reviewed May 12, 2021",They were very good at keeping me informed during the process. My loan originator was always professional and informative. It took very little of my time. They picked the closing company and she came to my work for the closing. I would recommend them highly..,5
Kim,"Abingdon, MD","Reviewed May 12, 2021","The AmeriSave website and the portal where you upload documents are horrific. They ask for the same information. I counted about eight times I had to upload the same stuff. The biggest thing they need to really take care of is that portal. They only accept PDF format. It should clearly say, “Do not try to upload a .doc. Upload a PDF.” If it's missing something or something's wrong, there should be some alert that comes back to you. Instead, you just wait. You think you've finished. Then three days later, you get a canned email that you have to go back to the portal and you're reloading everything you just finished loading. You don't even know what happened or why you're doing it again. It was just frustrating.",4

Jeffrey,"Bradenton, FL","Reviewed May 12, 2021","Technology has allowed people to do a lot of things differently in applications and although the process at AmeriSave wasn’t the best I’ve ever had, it wasn’t the worst. It was efficient and accomplished the mission. My credit score was excellent, so that simplified the process and made it a little bit easier. I provided documentation and uploaded them. I refinanced two properties and the one down South was a little bit easier because there were more comps. But getting an appraiser for the one up North was difficult. AmeriSave has good contracts with good people but not so much in rural areas. They could work on the efficiency of the appraisals. ",5

He was very helpful and I was happy with his work. But I wasn't really thrilled with his assistant that we gave all the information to because we had to send things four times before they ever got all the information right. It was so aggravating and frustrating. I was gonna pull the whole thing. I called Thomas about it and he would tell me that they got this and that. But his assistant kept wanting more and more of the same thing. Another thing was the process took so long. They kept saying it was because the VA was overwhelmed. Everybody with the VA was doing it now because the rates have dropped so low. I talked to Thomas and three days later, we had things done. Other than those, AmeriSave was pretty good.",4

Anthony,"Newark, DE","Reviewed May 10, 2021","The refinance process was really simple. It was just a matter of having the right documentation and providing all the info that they needed. But, when I had to deal with the appraiser, they changed the timeframe unexpectedly. There was a little mix-up with the communication with that. Other than that, everything was fine. My rep kept me on top of everything that was going on. He was thorough and tried to find me a good rate. He stayed in touch with me pretty well through the process. I was satisfied and very comfortable working with him.",5
Miguel,"Mercedes, TX","Reviewed May 10, 2021","The process was really good up until we had a situation where they had to resubmit my loan. I was ready to close one day then I got a call the day before saying it got stalled. We had to go back to the beginning. It got stalled another four weeks, which put us in a bind. That aside, my rep did an outstanding job. I was just a victim of the machine there. She did tell me that they were switching over to a new system and it sort of threw everything off. The process itself was actually very easy from what I've experienced in the past. The rate and terms I got were great. We're doing so much better than we were before.",5
A.,"Ga, GA","Reviewed May 10, 2021","The process was very quick and I was surprised. AmeriSave didn’t overload me with so much paperwork as well for the refinance. I was worried that they would have given me a lot of paperwork, like the time when I got my initial mortgage. However, it was very smooth and efficient. The rep was very responsive, answering questions, getting back on time and he also moved quickly in terms of giving me a new interest rate the same day. That was helpful. Overall, it was good. Everything went well with the refinancing.",5

I got frustrated how I emailed them or texted them something and they appeared to have misplaced it or didn't see it. Beyond that, everything went pretty well. The process was easy. The first time we got through the process, AmeriSave denied the application and told me the reason was because they were in the process of changing their applications. Mine was on an old application and I had to do a new one. They had approved it then. The process took about five weeks but it could have been a lot shorter. ",5
Dana,"Austin, TX","Reviewed May 8, 2021","RoundPoint bought our mortgage. But, they kept asking for redundancy and they changed the interest rate without telling me. So, I canceled the sale with them. The rates looked good at AmeriSave so I gave it a shot. Everything went off pretty smoothly. However, there were a couple of glitches in their software as the guy we were dealing with didn't realize that we had to go to another menu to upload certain documents. So, he called me and said I need to send something in. I looked up in the corner and saw that I could pull down another menu for downloads and found it. But, even that guy didn't know where it was. ",5
Ona,"Fort Smith, AR","Reviewed May 8, 2021","I didn't want to do the loan at first because it was so much trouble but I'm so very glad I did now. I did a 30-year loan and it's fixed at 2.5. The process turned out to be okay and most of it was done online. I had a lot of help from my daughters. They both have power of attorney and they had me sign everything. Mostly though, I did it by myself with the loan originator. I would like to have done a better job on my end. I'm not good online. It would take me a while and it takes a lot of patience with whoever I'm working with. ",5

Jerry,"Northglenn, CO","Reviewed May 7, 2021","I liked what AmeriSave was saying and what their approach was. I had six credit cards they were supposed to have paid off. I had six checks to send to those but two of them were identical, and one was not even for the one that I needed. So, I said no and AmeriSave sent me a check for the one that was missing. But, I still have an extra check, and I haven’t heard back from them yet. Other than that, if you're thinking about refinance, go through AmeriSave. It's very friendly and easy to get through.",5
Mavis,"Trumbull, CT","Reviewed May 6, 2021","I refinanced with them and it was painful. Every week, there was something that changed and I had to submit the same documents over and over again. Also, once they pass the documents over to another person, there was no communication. Nobody returns a call. Nothing was clear. The rate wasn't bad but I didn't do as well as I thought. That held me back because my terms went up by two additional years. I think I can go back and bring it back down to where it was. But someone needs to let me know if I'm getting back any money from AmeriSave and how much it is.",1
Richard,"Vienna, VA","Reviewed May 6, 2021","The application process was very iterative and the amount of documentation we had to submit was very intense. They’d make requests, and then I'd submit the documents. They make more requests and I’d submit more documents. It seemed like we just kept moving closer to the goalposts. The reps were very professional, informative and very proactive. I'm happy with the final product, and I'm happy that it worked.",5
Tony,"Carlsbad, CA","Reviewed May 5, 2021","In the beginning, it was a nightmare. The first rep was really frustrating. It took us four months to do the loan. Also, the process can be improved. For example, when AmeriSave needs a document, I had to provide and every three weeks, I get another document request. By the time I got the last request, the first one is already out. The rep said that because the first document was already a couple of months old, could I send another one. That dragged the loan process so long. ",3
Steve,"Largo, FL","Reviewed May 5, 2021","I was using RP Funding and they were dropping the ball left and right. That's when I reached out to AmeriSave and started working with Matthew. Initially, I didn't know they could also cover closing costs. Matthew knew his stuff. He ran me through the numbers and helped me out. The only thing I didn't like was the withholding of the $500. If I were to choose someone else, I wouldn't be able to get that 500 back, by shopping around. Other than that, they gave me good rates that were in line with everything else. Also, communication was excellent. They did everything they could to maximize what I needed for cash out.",5

Efrain,"Parma Heights, OH","Reviewed April 27, 2021","It was a good experience with AmeriSave. This is the first in my life I have done anything this big online. I would have never done this. The fact that I had to do it online, I was skeptical. So, having a brick-and-mortar type of contact would probably bring them even more business. But I had an awesome rep. He was very patient and that was important. He covered every question I had. He was very thorough. He checked me and said, “Why don't you do it this way?” He talked me out of the FHA to save me the private mortgage insurance. Because he said, “With a credit score as high as yours, we can work with this. Why would you pay PMI and stay with FHA, when we can remove that PMI and put you in a conventional loan?” Which I never thought I could do.",5
Korina,"Elkton, MD","Reviewed April 26, 2021","Positively awful experience and the most arduous waste of time with AmeriSave Mortgage for our home refinance. After a very long, drawn out, exhausting duplicate stall tactic process and a $500 application fee, AmeriSave decided to CANCEL our application without even telling us! From their dysfunctional interface to submitting multiple requests for duplicate documentation we realize there is a much larger issue within AmeriSave. We cannot even speak to our former loan officer. He has even blocked our email address. No one will return our calls in reference to our $500 application fee that should be refunded to us. I highly suggest consumers NOT use AmeriSave Mortgage!!",1
Rachel,"Clover, SC","Reviewed April 26, 2021","My refinance began at the end of November and took until the end of April to get a closing date. I can accept delays due to holidays, etc. but this was absolutely ridiculous. Communication was so poor. Underwriting repeatedly asked for the same documents over and over again, which I continued to submit, then the loan would be held up an entire week, just for them to ask me to submit another copy of the same document. I questioned the loan originator and closing coordinator multiple times about this, and literally never received a response.",1
Stephen,"Lowell, MA","Reviewed April 26, 2021","The process took a long time due to some kind of underwriting issues but other than that, it was fine.

Donald,"Myersville, MD","Reviewed April 24, 2021","Applying online was the smoothest process I've been through so far. AmeriSave also fulfilled every goal that I had (the low interest rate, keeping the term, and dropping the PMI). It wasn't just talk. It happened and I'm saving $200 a month. The other thing was I skipped a payment. That's not unusual, but it was nice. My daughter is getting married, and it helped a bit. I was completely satisfied with everything.

Sometimes I'm skeptical of companies engaging in ""bait-and-switch"" tactics, but that was NOT the case with AmeriSave. I got the interest rate that they had promised from the very beginning. The only negative is that the loan took about a week longer than expected to close. Looking at the big picture, that was only a minor inconvenience. In fact, my experience was so positive that I am working with them on another for a second home. Terrence ** was my loan originator and he has been excellent to work with.",5

John,"Pittsburgh, PA","Reviewed April 22, 2021","I went and registered at a couple of different places and Amerisave was the only one that called me back to be interested in such a small mortgage. The rep, Henry, gave me a great interest rate. He told me, “I can't wait too many days because they're starting to go up.” I talked to my wife that evening and I got ahold of him the following morning. He locked the interest rate in for us. It was 1.8% which is the lowest I've seen online. Even when the young lady came to do the notary work, she was surprised. She said, “This is the lowest one I've done all week.”",5

It was an okay process but it took a long time and the interest rate wasn't that great. When the interest rates went really low, I refinanced again. I did what I never do which is go on the internet and google low interest rates. Amerisave popped up and I found out they're out of Atlanta, Georgia which is close to where I live. I started the process and it’s always a long and painful one but Amerisave was as good as I could imagine. The guy that serviced my loan did a really good job. They don't let the client sit on paperwork for a long time. Every time there was something in my portal or my inbox to sign or to do, I got an email and sometimes a call, which is helpful. It probably sped the process up by 20 days by just making sure most of my documents that I was sent to sign would get right back to the portal within an hour or two. ",5

However, there's an automated system where there's a user portal and I kept getting erroneous requests for the same document over and over that wanted something signed. I did it and I reuploaded it.

He was very considerate to any of my concerns and made sure I knew what was going on all the time. They did a great job.",5
Sofia,"Santa Barbara, CA","Reviewed April 11, 2021","Excellent service, the agent Marquis ** was amazing!

Very efficient, very explanatory, and very straightforward! Thank you, Amerisave!",5
Michael,"Hickory, NC","Reviewed April 11, 2021","If you were technologically savvy, their process was very easy, clean and quick. They handed me off from the person who started with the application to the loan officer. It was a smooth handoff, both of them checked in with me from time to time making sure everything was going smoothly. I'd had a situation where I thought I uploaded the document, but the system wasn't saying it was there. So I sent a quick message to both of them, said, “Hey, I think this is there, but I'm not sure. Please confirm.” Within two hours, they had responded back. “Yeah, the document’s showing, not sure why the site wasn’t showing it. But yes, we have it.” They were on top of it.",5
Judy,"Fulton, KY","Reviewed April 11, 2021","I had never done this before so I had a lot of questions and a lot of the other lenders didn't call back but AmeriSave was very attentive and answered all my questions. Also, their interest rate was good. The only downside was their closing costs were a little high. Also, I had so much trouble with the application. Down here in Kentucky, the internet service isn't really well so the online application was a little tougher. But they helped me along the way and they showed me how to do things.",5
Jennifer,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed April 11, 2021",I was referred to AmeriSave by my ex-husband. He just refinanced with them and said that it was a fairly quick and simple procedure. I checked them out and it worked out fairly well. The rep I worked with was very responsive to any of my questions. He was very pleasant. They got me where I wanted to be and definitely saved me a few hundred dollars. I’m happy about that. Definitely better than where I was when I first got my mortgage.,5
Eve,"Sedley, VA","Reviewed April 10, 2021","Truthfully, from the beginning to the end, the process was seamless and transparency was front and center. Any questions I had were answered within hours. My experience was excellent, therefore, I would readily recommend AmeriSave for refinancing. Closing was also much sooner than expected.",5
David,"Laveen, AZ","Reviewed April 10, 2021","They have excellent communication. My loan officer was Samantha. She was extremely helpful. Every time I wanted to ask them a question, she always was either available or called me back immediately. The process was really fast. Compared to the other company that I went through, AmeriSave was so much better. When they told me it was done, it was done. There was no changing. They have a goalpost. I've been through a lot of refinances and original mortgage originations in my life, and this was easily the best.",5
Linda,"House Springs, MO","Reviewed April 10, 2021","They took so long that I had to resubmit paperwork because the original paperwork was now outdated. This happened at least two times. The closing documents that outlined what I needed to do/provide for closing were totally inaccurate. This caused more delays. I was later told that AmeriSave did not follow these rules, so why send them to me. Finally received my third or fourth closing document on a Friday. Set up my closing date/time for Monday at 8:30. They canceled this because 8:30 was too early for them to provide the documentation. They then took it upon themselves to charge my closing time to 5:00. I did not answer the phone the one time that they called me so they picked a time for me. Closed on 2/22/2021 and today is 4/10/2021 and I am still waiting to receive my new title/quick claim deed from them.",1
Angela,"Knoxville, TN","Reviewed April 10, 2021","This was the most pain-free and quick refi I've ever experienced. They were super helpful and took the time to explain one option that I had never considered before. When it was all said and done, I was able to drop PMI, lower my already low rate, move to a 15 year repayment plan when I had 25 years left on my previous mortgage, AND ended up saving around 50k in interest over the life of the new loan. I've even opted to pay just $30 more a month which should put me at paying it off in 11 years vs 15. I may actually be able to retire when retirement comes around!",5
Suzan,"San Pedro, CA","Reviewed April 10, 2021","My experience with AmeriSave can be broken into two distinct parts - before working with JR ** and after. Once he was involved, the loan process was completed in a timely and responsive manner. Before he was brought in to complete the loan, the loan originator was mostly non-responsive and refused to communicate in a timely manner. She was obviously inexperienced and unaware how to handle a loan with the complication of a land lease. Although she was very nice when I actually spoke with her, she ignored my repeated pleas for status. It took over 123 days to close this loan.",3
Leo,"Washington, DC","Reviewed April 10, 2021",After searching for the lowest rate at the lowest cost AmeriSave offered us both. Their loan personnel were a pleasure to work with. I’m very satisfied with my loan and would recommend AmeriSave to anyone in search of a loan.,5

Patti,"Midland, GA","Reviewed April 10, 2021",My experience was easy and pleasant from beginning to end. Thomas ** (I think that’s his last name) led me step by step. His response time if I had a question was amazing. He returned my call or text within 15 minutes every time. The process was very quick.

Steve,"East Stroudsburg, PA","Reviewed April 10, 2021",The application process was very easy. I did it online then they contacted me. It didn’t take that long either.

Radford,"Harrodsburg, KY","Reviewed April 10, 2021","Going to AmeriSave's application process online was simple. We only had one issue I had with the whole process. In 2000, the people that owned the place had the property foreclosed. A broker bought it from them and I bought it in '02 which was set for all that time and I've refinanced it twice. I sold a property in June of last year. The broker put a thing on the property that said it was a foreclosure. They messed the paperwork up.",5
Terry,"Plymouth, MN","Reviewed April 9, 2021","Had a great experience with Stephen and Tammie from Amerisave. They handled everything accurately, quickly and were very personable.

Carrie,"Adel, GA","Reviewed April 9, 2021",This is by far the worst mortgage company from start to finish. I would never recommend them. My loan was a disaster and messed up that caused many delays. Now my mortgage is messed up and still 3 months later trying to get back monies that was overpaid due to their mistake with my insurance and had to have it taken out of my escrow. They owe me about 500 and still have my payments the same causing me to double pay and even after the escrow analysis. Lots of promises and nothing more. Good luck getting anything resolved as I have sent 6 emails and no response. Call customer service and they will transfer you to every dept as it is not their problem. Pass the buck as you would say. All I can say is good luck and may the power be with you if you go with them. I am going on my 4th payment now and can't wait to change lenders. I hate even giving them 1 star but you have to give something to do the review.,3

Brenda,"Alpharetta, GA","Reviewed April 9, 2021","The first person I spoke with, Joseph, was very responsive and answered all my questions. He would respond to my emails or calls in a timely manner and he was easy to work with. But for the closing, a guy had to come out to my house and the scheduling of that from the underwriting wasn't coordinated very well. I spent one day waiting all day and no one showed. That was on a Friday. But they came out that next Monday. Other than that, the appraisal was done when it was scheduled. The rep came out on that day at the time and the appraisal was good.",5

Christopher,"Oakton, VA","Reviewed April 8, 2021",Amerisave's application process was not the best but I've had similar experiences doing mortgages and refinances so it seems to be consistently lackluster across the board from a user experience perspective. There are a lot of duplication and a lot of learning that are going on in the web based transactions related to mortgages. But they're doing the best that they can and the tools are catching up. The big thing that Amerisave did do well despite the limitations of the tool was having a responsive representative. They have friendly representatives that are willing to answer questions and work through to satisfy objectives.,5
Courtney,"Tacoma, WA","Reviewed April 8, 2021","They had the rate information on the website that I found where I could just look at. It gave me the list of rates with the fees associated with it. So I could just see upfront how much I was buying or paying to get the particular rate I was looking for and get a sense of that right at the very beginning. I started the process of entering my information onto AmeriSave's website. Once the person who called me spoke with me, he was just fantastic.",5
Srinath,"Murfreesboro, TN","Reviewed April 8, 2021","Anthony provided a lot of options, which really helped to have an offline conversation among the family members.

Dave,"Miami, FL","Reviewed April 7, 2021","On January 21, 2021 I started a mortgage refinance process with Amerisave Mortgage. My Loan processor was Bryce **. Bryce and I discussed the loan, including the loan rate. I was happy with the initial loan rate of 2.75% for a 30 year mortgage. I asked Bryce to “lock-in” the rate. Bryce explained that it was Amerisave’s policy not to lock in rates because “if the rate dropped, the customer benefits and if the rate goes up, Amerisave will issue an exemption to get the rate back to the rate on the signed disclosure.” This sounded like a great deal to me, a can’t lose situation.

Edward,"Lockport, IL","Reviewed April 7, 2021","I have a friend that had just refied and he told me about the rate he got. He said that Amerisave's service was good and doing everything online was real easy. They have the closer come up to the house to do the closing. I did the application on a Sunday night at about 6 o'clock. When the options popped up where it showed what I wanted to do as far as did I want a lesser percentage rate, a lesser mortgage payment and less years, that was good. It gave me a number of options and the approximate monthly payment next to the options. I picked the one with the lowest possible monthly payment then ran through it. I got a call the next morning from the originator. I was shocked because the rate that popped up on the screen was 2.75 and when the originator called me back, he said it was down to 2.25 so I couldn't be happier. I locked in immediately and was thoroughly impressed by how quickly things went and how easily things were able to be done. ",5
Jim,"Glendale, AZ","Reviewed April 7, 2021","Everything went very well with AmeriSave. They offered me the best deal for the lowest price. The rep was really great. Kept me informed on everything, whether it was an email or a call. We only had one snafu and it wasn't on his part. It was on the notary’s part. They just couldn't pick up the times that I explained I needed for them to come due to my schedule. But they were finally able to add an extra week and were able to schedule him and get it at the times I needed them. AmeriSave was one of the best ones I found.",5
John,"Heathsville, VA","Reviewed April 7, 2021","The process with AmeriSave was one of the easiest mortgages I've ever done.

Lauren,"Rancho Cordova, CA","Reviewed April 6, 2021","So far so good. Everything went well in the process and closing. It seems like we got a good deal. I guess only time will tell though as I am not super knowledgeable with all this stuff. Jordan was very helpful, and available when needed.",5
Sam,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed April 6, 2021","At first, Amerisave told me the rates would change. It'd be a floating rate which was suspicious but they cleared that up.

Also, they have a website where I could create an account and log in so I could keep track of the process. The whole setup of AmeriSave is really good.

I got approved of that and they were supposed to wire the money to Amerisave on March the 22nd. Amerisave sent the money back to First Am because the amount wasn't right and they didn't have correct payoff amount. I had a payment scheduled for March the 16th to pay $1,094.83. After I scheduled that payment, two hours later, my loan processor called and told me that she had great news, that we were going to close on the 17th. I tried to cancel that payment but I couldn't.

Jason,"Whittier, CA","Reviewed April 3, 2021","I talked to quite a few lenders and John from Amerisave gave me some good information that shifted a lot of things I had planned.

When I contacted him, he walked me through and asked me a few questions to try to understand what my needs were and what I wanted to accomplish. From there, he was able to point me in the right direction. Once I ended up coming back, he pretty much told me the same thing. He walked me through completing the application which was nice. He was able to reply to me either through phone call or email. Whichever method I wanted, he made himself available if I had any questions. I've done quite a bit of loans and refinances and by far, this has been the best experience I've had because I grew as far as content knowledge is concerned. I was hoping to go a little lower on the rates but I was fine with it.",5

It seemed like it was kind of a pain for my HOA stuff to get whatever information they needed when they were supposed to. I ended up having to go several times and intermediate that half a dozen or more times. It was very frustrating but that was the only unpleasant experience.

We went all the way ‘til January, about 70 days later when it was ready to close.

Their rate was the best that I received of the options that I sought so that was one of the factors I chose them. The rep, Sharon, was very thorough and followed up regularly. The only complication we had was with the title company. Our house was in a trust and there were some complications in how that was put together in the closing documents. There were some of the signature lines that were kind of mixed up in the closing process. It may have been done right but it was confusing to me and we ended up having to delay our closing to make sure all that was correct. I don't think that was anybody's fault though.

Samson,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed March 29, 2021","I write this review to help others make an informed decision on selecting a dependable company for home refinance based on my experience. Unfortunately, I am having a horrible experience primarily due to lack of communication.

During this time period, I missed the opportunity to lock in a solid rate because rates have increased since then. I had to initiate several of the conversations and would on occasion receive automated reminder texts because my financial documents would need to be updated. Perhaps it was the loan originator, so I attempted to switch over to a new loan originator, Jordan **. I was instructed it would take one hour to switch over the loan originator in the system and I would get a call back. Never got a call back. Where is the professionalism?",1
William,"Elk Grove Village, IL","Reviewed March 29, 2021",There were some communication issues that made the process take a little longer than it should have.

We got good interest rates and the closing costs were lower than anybody else we could find.,4

Nancy,"Fontana, CA","Reviewed March 28, 2021","I had already been starting the process with another company and wasn't satisfied at all so I started shopping again. Michael, the specialist that I contacted, was the second one that contacted me. The conversation, the rates and the whole process of him convinced me to go with Amerisave. The whole package was beautiful. There was a little bit of miscommunication at the beginning. The title company requested my husband's death certificate but he’s still alive. That part did scare me a little. The names were not that clear so they had to be corrected but they were fixed right away. ",5

Lynn asked if it would be better to communicate through text or phone call. In the beginning, texting was good then we were able to touch base through a phone call. She went through everything. I told her what I was looking for and she went through what she felt was best. She sent me all the numbers. I was looking at a couple of different rates. She talked about the closing costs and she was really informative. I've never experienced that before with anybody so it was nice. She said, “If you go through this, your closing costs will be a little bit higher,” then explained the reason why. She worked with me as far as good timing for me and not for her. She was good at calling and shooting me a message. I live a busy lifestyle so I loved the text message from Lynn saying she sent a document that you needed to go over. It was so much easier. ",5

For someone that's going to help you through the entire process and friendly, keeps you updated, and doesn’t leave you hanging, I would go with AmeriSave. The only thing that I wish AmeriSave didn't do is sold my mortgage already and sold it to Fannie Mae.",5

Sometimes, there are a little bit annoying reminders for the documents that I already uploaded. Why was I being asked for the same documents over and over again? The reps told me it was because there was a bug in the system.",3
Jay,"Cherry Hill, NJ","Reviewed March 26, 2021",Amerisave was more flexible and the rates and fees were better than some of the other competitors. Everything went fine though there were a couple hiccups as far as removing the escrow 'cause I pay my own taxes and my own insurance.

They could let folks know what their process is and how they help get the loan needed. But Mahmoud, the rep I worked with, was very involved. The belief that they're not trying to take me for my money type of feeling helped with my anxiety. Somebody was legitimately working with me, making sure that I had all the information, and walked me through the process on the website. I felt good about it. One minor complaint I have is that when I believed the checks were going to go to the bank, it was mailed to my home. I'm temporarily assigned in another state and I had to drive all the way back to handle the business.",5

I asked repeatedly to lock the rate and fees during the process, they said that wouldn't be necessary and it was ""guaranteed"" to stay the same while I closed the one, single and last title company item. I kept insisting, they kept assuring that it wasn't necessary. They refused to lock the rate and fees. They said in no uncertain terms, that the risk was on them, not me.

Now, had I not had to request it, we probably would have closed in less than three weeks. I had everything ready but I didn't have that letter. So when I got the letter, they closed in no time. There was a glitch from the attorney's office that closed our home, mailing the checks to State Farm to pay off our vehicles. This had been going on since February 11th but it finally cleared yesterday. When we needed some help getting the closure on the vehicle, I got a little frustrated because I'd call our rep and text him and he wouldn't call me back. So then I would finally get a text. I'd rather have had a phone call than a text. Other than that, when I called, he was pretty on the spot.",5

That was the only thing that I had trouble with.",4
Timothy,"West Caldwell, NJ","Reviewed March 22, 2021","I was looking for a lower rate. AmeriSave's application process was pretty smooth and the underwriting process took about 45 to 60 days.

He answered all of my questions and even if I had silly questions, he didn't make me feel crazy for asking those. AmeriSave made the process easy as well. They got the ball going really fast, and then my previous mortgage company wouldn't return their phone calls. They made it a little hard for them, but then I called to check up on it, and they told me what they needed. I called my mortgage company and got the ball rolling again for them. ",5

Even when we had some struggles of funding the loan and there was a miscommunication with that, he was an advocate for me at all times. The only thing was we did a little cash out and it was supposed to be funded in three days but it turned out to be six days. Derek had to escalate it to his supervisor.

I talked to my loan officer the first time when I initiated the loan and that was the very last time I ever talked to her. When things went slightly awry and they had the wrong good faith estimate and other stuff together that were not as committed, I had to talk to her. But it always seemed like it was a struggle getting ahold of people. They don't ever want to be in verbal communication.",3

They kept asking for the documents and wanting to know the payoff for something I wasn't getting the loan for. It was just weird. Curtis had to do a lot of apologizing for the underwriters and everything else. On the whole, I wouldn't recommend AmeriSave. Try somebody else.",1
Xuan,"Provo, UT","Reviewed March 9, 2021","Amerisave was very clear in what they offered me. They were very fast and straightforward. In the beginning, I needed some time to get used to it but it was flawless. There was no pushing. I had a better offer from another company but they pushed me a lot to do this and that. I had applied for several refinancing and that company asked me to cancel with everyone else. That was what I didn't want to do.",5
Elizabeth,"Denver, CO","Reviewed March 9, 2021","I looked up AmeriSave on the computer and I was pleased. I dealt with Jessica and she was wonderful. She helped me along the way and her kindness, understanding and efficiency were well appreciated. Once I figured out how to sign stuff and get it to her, it was simple. She was very patient since I’m supposedly a senior citizen and when you don't understand the computer, it was reassuring that she would help you through it. AmeriSave was very efficient and good.",5
Michelle,"Fredericksburg, VA","Reviewed March 8, 2021","AmeriSave had a really good interest rate so I was able to refinance from a 3.5 to a 2.5 for 15 years as opposed to 30 years. Everything went really well. I dealt with Sarah and she was absolutely amazing. I ask a lot of questions and I can probably be quite a pain sometimes, but she was always really good about getting back to me and answering all my questions. ",5
James,"Tacoma, WA","Reviewed March 8, 2021",It was a good experience. I wasn't expecting it to go so easy. I wish I would have done a little more homework going into it but they did a really good job.,5
Sandra,"Sicklerville, NJ","Reviewed March 8, 2021","Everything was great with AmeriSave. The process went smoothly especially with Michael, the rep, and his assistant. Everything that I sent was easily handled through them. Also, I could do everything online. When I went to the website, whatever I had to sign off was available. The only thing that held up everything was the weather because I settled on the 16th and I didn't get the money until two weeks later. So, all of my debt is clearing now. If it weren't for the storm, it was perfect. I was in so much debt and this has helped me. It has changed my life and made it so much easier.",5
Laurence,"Waxhaw, NC","Reviewed March 7, 2021",I went to AmeriSave because they do a cash-out refi with no extra fees and it was relatively easy. The overall process was pretty smooth. The ease of uploading documents was relatively simple. I worked with two people and they were both excellent.,5

I am so happy to have refinanced with Amerisave!",5
Paulo,"Parker, CO","Reviewed March 6, 2021","I did some research online and AmeriSave seemed to have good rates. I worked with them to refinance my investment property and my primary. The application and underwriting took over two months. I expected it to take less time. They said that it took a little longer than expected because they needed some documentation from our association in our investment property. Our primary moved a little faster because we started later and finished first. Ernest was our rep and he was good. He was always returning my calls. He always talked to me when needed and when I had questions. I need him now. I have a question. Now that everything is finalized, AmeriSave is not getting back to me anymore. ",4
Sean,"Spokane Valley, WA","Reviewed March 6, 2021","My rep was great. He helped me to get a lower rate than what I anticipated. I'm happy about it. I don't know anybody that has as low rate as I got so I always tell my coworkers how good a rate it was. It was a super easy process and it went real good. It was all done with eSign and online. Even when I had to sign the documents, the gentleman came to my house which was convenient. Every time in the past, I've always had to go to an actual title building.",5
Patrick,"Carlsbad, CA","Reviewed March 6, 2021","I went online looking for lenders to refi and AmeriSave was the best interest rate I could find. The application process was all good.

AmeriSave worked out well.",5
Ricardo,"Miami, FL","Reviewed March 5, 2021","AmeriSave was a referral. I reached out to them among others, and they gave me the best deal. Salvador was my rep. He was knowledgeable and he gave me a good treatment. Any emails or questions I sent, they were very responsive. Also, they were easy to deal with and attentive. I didn't get much response from there as far as explaining the whole closing costs. Like the day before closing, going over what I’m signing. Things do change, and the process with them. That was more of the process with the loan processor. Otherwise, I had a great experience. I would recommend AmeriSave to anyone else.",5
Benly,"Wayne, NJ","Reviewed March 5, 2021",One of the things that stood out with Amerisave was the quality of service when I talked to the person that was working with me. He was quite responsive to all my queries. There were times when he did not have an answer and he would let me know that he would come back on it. He was good at keeping in touch on the emails. I would love to have him again if I get another chance. Another thing is that there was a clear communication during the process around all the questions that I raised regarding the interest rates and making sure that the numbers are correct even before the whole process was put in for closing purposes. ,5
Edwin,"Peoria, AZ","Reviewed March 5, 2021","The timespan was one thing that was astounding to us. We started in December and the refinance was taken care of by the 1st of February, which is good for us. AmeriSave followed through with everything they said they were going to do. We were very happy with dealing with the rep, Lynn. She answered all of our questions. We worked with the title company that works with AmeriSave and they would call us and I would call them back. I would miss the call by five minutes and they would never return my phone call. So, I would have to call Lynn and Lynn would get a hold of them, and then, they would call me back, which was not right. But AmeriSave did a great job.",5
Carmen,"Murfreesboro, TN","Reviewed March 4, 2021",I came to AmeriSave as a result of trying for nine months to refinance with my existing loan company. AmeriSave did a great job of taking me away from them and saving me a lot of money. I had a great experience with the whole thing. It was very easy. The guy that helped me was super helpful and very efficient. Everybody did what they were supposed to do in a timely manner.,5
Michael,"Mechanicsburg, PA","Reviewed March 4, 2021","I'm a very difficult consumer to capture and I would compare the offers very carefully. AmeriSave had the best deal and the mortgage officer, Josh, went out of his way to make sure it was the best deal possible. He was super simple to work with. We went over the options as far as buying it down and the cost I was gonna incur from buying it down versus getting the better rate. We tweaked it out. I'm kind of high maintenance sometimes and he was good about it. He went out of the way to make sure he did it right so I was pretty impressed with that. He was on top of everything. He and I were both making sure that as soon as something was needed, I got it. He was good at communicating with me.",5
Richard,"Schwenksville, PA","Reviewed March 4, 2021","I had a mortgage broker who had previously done a refi for me and I reached out to him. From speaking to him, I was a little concerned about having to pay certain closing costs. So, I did a little internet research and AmeriSave was at the top of the list. I just started the process online and I couldn't have been happier with the ultimate result. Everything was seamless and Rebecca, the rep, was excellent. She was very knowledgeable and was always there to answer questions and stayed on top of things. She was great from start to finish.",5
Jessica,"Fair Oaks, CA","Reviewed March 3, 2021","I loved my AmeriSave mortgage broker. He was easy to deal with and responsive. When I talked to him on the phone, he was very professional and he took his time. He wasn't trying to get me off the phone, which seems a lot of them are just trying to run your credit. He did all of it before, so it was really nice. He did a good job. It took less than 30 days. It was quick.",5
Russell,"Hanover, MD","Reviewed March 3, 2021","Amerisave had the lowest rate and the fastest response time. It was a week from the time I accepted to sign the final papers and everything was official. The application only took me about 10 minutes and the underwriting took less than a week even though I was shopping around for other companies. The rep did his job. I liked how fast he responded. I did accept the offer late on a Monday night and he called me and said, “All right, let’s do it.” They answered every question I had.",5
Robin,"Loganville, GA","Reviewed March 3, 2021","I tried to get my mortgage rate lowered and everything went smoothly with AmeriSave. Lee, the rep, was awesome. He said that he was gonna make me and my daughter happy and he did. We wanted to get a 15-year rate and they kept telling us we couldn’t do it. But we've been paying the same thing that we were gonna pay, and they got it existing. So, we’re very excited.",5
Adam,"Trenton, IL","Reviewed March 2, 2021","The rep is quick to reply. Any questions I had, he answered them. I went from a 30-year loan to a 15-year loan, and AmeriSave didn't even change my payment.",5
S.,"Ca, CA","Reviewed March 2, 2021",Amerisave is a company I would use again or look into. They had the lowest interest rate and I'm happy with them. The rep was excellent too.,5
Shady,"Big Bear City, CA","Reviewed March 2, 2021",I just wanted a better interest rate and AmeriSave answered the phone the quickest. The online application process was fairly easy. The rate and the terms I received were what I wanted.,4
Stephanie,"Allentown, PA","Reviewed March 1, 2021",I considered refinancing but was skeptical if I would proceed with it. I received a call from Amerisave offering to get me good rates but in order to do this was asked to give 500 dollars which I was not told was for the quotes. I backed down and decided not to go through with the process and now I'm told it was an application fee and non refundable. If this had been made clear to me from the beginning I would have not proceeded with the so called getting quotes. 500 is a lot of money for quotes. Sorry but I consider them predatory.,5
Sudeep,"Greer, SC","Reviewed March 1, 2021",Everything went well with AmeriSave. My loan rep was very good at replying to my messages and good at taking the loan quickly to underwriting. I'm very much satisfied with the rates I got. I'm still waiting for the closing check from them. I expect it this week.,5
Vicky,"San Francisco, CA","Reviewed March 1, 2021","We refinanced our investment property and in general, the process was very smooth. There were a couple of hiccups though. I sent a document, and then the request popped back again, but my loan officer fixed it right away. The rate and terms were nothing better we could ask too. AmeriSave's rates are very competitive if you are looking for a rental property refi. It’s the lowest rate I could find. Also, I would suggest that people look for a broker that other people recommend. Through me, I would totally refer my loan officer. He's awesome. He’s on top of everything and he responds right away.",5
Judy,"Bakersfield, CA","Reviewed March 1, 2021","AmeriSave said they could get me the lowest interest, and it went up some by the time it was lockdown. It just seemed like they jumped on it. But they were patient with the online stuff that I wasn't familiar with and guided me through the process so it worked out well.",4
Erin,"Trenton, NJ","Reviewed Feb. 28, 2021","I switched to AmeriSave as they had lower rates. I did a refinance with them and the process was smooth and seamless. It was so easy. Their online application process was very good and user-friendly. Rates-wise, I went from a 4.6 to a 2.6. The reps were very knowledgeable in the field and they answered all my questions. They were only a phone call away and were easy to get a hold of. They were super friendly. Everything was positive.",5
Mohit,"Hoover, AL","Reviewed Feb. 28, 2021","I asked my friend where he got his home loan refinanced and he told me that it was from AmeriSave. He gave me a reference.

If you want a fresh home loan or refinance a home loan without any headache and inconvenience, then go to AmeriSave.",5
Semaan,"South Hamilton, MA","Reviewed Feb. 27, 2021",This is my fifth time using AmeriSave. I did cash out with them. The online application process was pretty straightforward. The process was great and it took two to three weeks from the start to finish. My rates and terms were okay. That's the best we can get at that point and I have no problems with that. I'm very satisfied. The only thing is the law offices that AmeriSave uses were slow in getting the money to me and they were disorganized. That would be something that should be faster. ,5
Claudette,"Alexandria, VA","Reviewed Feb. 27, 2021","AmeriSave had great reviews and also reasonable interest rates. Jacob was awesome, and also, Angela, who was his processor. It's not my first refinance, so I had very specific questions and anything that I had concerns and questions about, the turnaround was very quick and the response was correct, educated, like they had a backup for whatever was happening. Overall, they did a great job. I cannot complain.",5
Robert,"Huntington Beach, CA","Reviewed Feb. 26, 2021",Was pleased with the services although making contact with agents was difficult at times. We certainly understand that Covid played a part in the process and would not hesitate to recommend the AmeriSave team to any of our friends.,4
Jeffrey,"Medford, OR","Reviewed Feb. 26, 2021","I went online and AmeriSave was one of the top 10. I happened to contact them through that. I also noticed that they had a lot of advertisements on TV, after the fact. I contacted them with an email then I received a phone call from one of the brokers there. They gave all the emails and they just told me what I needed to supply them with. I sent them PDFs of the information they needed for the loan. They got back to me if they needed something different or something else. The online application process was pretty good.",5
Salvatore,"Front Royal, VA","Reviewed Feb. 26, 2021",The application process with AmeriSave was very simple and the guys helped me. They were nice and very good people. The rates and terms of the mortgage was fair. It was very close to the advertising that I saw.,5
D.,"Sc, SC","Reviewed Feb. 25, 2021","Refinancing is a long process. So, the beginning phone calls are probably the most important because those are the time you are entering this thing and getting more detailed information. Every time I call AmeriSave, the rep there picks up the phone. They helped me all the time in the first half of the process. That's good enough for me and that's why I like AmeriSave. They also had a lower rate. After the first part of the process, their rep was no longer there always talking to me. I understand that. I'm doing a second mortgage with them as well.",4
Dave,"Sterling, VA","Reviewed Feb. 25, 2021",I got a cash out refinance from AmeriSave and the process was great as well as the rep. The rate and terms were as good as I was gonna find.,5
John,"Doylestown, PA","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2021",It was great with Amerisave. The person that called me back right away was very professional and knowledgeable compared to a few of the others. It was a search I had done on the internet and I got calls back from three or four different companies. Amerisave was by far the best impression. They had the best rates and the total costs of the loan were very good. There were no surprise fees. They also made the closing very easy.,5

Brett now says the rate won't be locked until almost closing.

David,"North Andover, MA","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2021","The process is terrible. But the person who ran the process was the most helpful person I've ever worked with. I've done this before. It was the first time that I did it with one of these national things where everything literally is done through the internet. I had a woman named Jessica and of all the people who called me when I was trying to decide what I wanted to do, she kept, not nagging me, but saying, “Hey, I'm here.” And that worked out good. I finally said, “Okay, I'll see what she's got.” And I said, “I want to have the lowest interest rate possible so that my monthly payment would be as low as possible.” That means that I don't have to worry about having some excess points sitting around. Because I can always deduct that, assuming we go back to that normal tax thing.",4
Laura,"Apopka, FL","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2021",I was satisfied with the services that AmeriSave gave to me.

Ismael,"Morrisville, NC","Reviewed Feb. 23, 2021","Excellent customer first approach and delivery. They supported and clarified all my concerns promptly.

The entire process was super smooth. What really bothers me is this autopay thing. I still don't have clear instructions about how to set it up. I cannot care less because they're the ones who get paid and I don't know what they want. I emailed them several times about it and no one answered me. Getting paid should be the easiest thing because it's in their interest.",5
Marcy,"Estero, FL","Reviewed Feb. 22, 2021",We worked with Mae **. She was the best. Very efficient! followed through on every email/question we had in a very timely manner.

Omar,"Katy, TX","Reviewed Feb. 20, 2021","The rep was very good and helpful during our refinance with AmeriSave. But the application and underwriting process took a long time. They said it was because of the delay on the mortgage insurance. It took at least three months to close it. In the mortgage that I had before with Cardinal, I was given a date since Day One. They said that they were gonna close at this date and they were very tight on time. We had plenty of time. But with AmeriSave, I didn’t have a closing date at first. After three months, I got a call and they said that they could close after a week. Other than that, everything else was good with AmeriSave. I'm happy.",5

Melanie,"Fort Mill, SC","Reviewed Feb. 17, 2021","AmeriSave creates a facade that they are responsive and professional to encourage confidence until the application fee is paid, followed by a complete lack of professionalism and absence of communication. We were lured in with promises of low interest rates and points, but then upon receiving our Closing Disclosure 5 weeks into the process, our closing costs had increased by over $2000 despite having signed for a rate-lock of interest rate and points weeks prior. After multiple unanswered voicemails and emails, I was finally able to speak with our loan officer, Jacob ** (NMLS ID **), who acted inconvenienced to answer my questions and became hostile and defensive when asked to clarify the discrepancies.

Pavel,"Ocean View, DE","Reviewed Feb. 16, 2021","The application and underwriting process was fairly easy and it was done within one month. Also, it was very pleasant and professional with the rep I worked with. The only thing was the gentleman who came here for closing didn't introduce himself. I learned his name because there was a little misrepresentation when I have to pay my portion of the escrow to the law firm. I wrote a check for 2,500 and he forgot the check here. He sent me a text that night and I knew his name when he sent me the text. Then, I received a phone call that they cannot accept the check because it was for 2,500 so they asked me if I can wire it. They sent me the check back overnight. It was pretty quick. But the person who is doing the closing should be knowledgeable as to what amount the check can be cut.",5
Sharnet,"Chandler, AZ","Reviewed Feb. 15, 2021","Mid December I applied with Amerisave to refi my home and worked with Tiffany **. She helped my through the process and got preapproved 2x for my refi. She said my income was good and my ratio to debt was within range especially after I roll in my credit cards. Once my file went to underwriting they asked a couple minor questions such as, ""How do you get paid"" even though I gave them 2 years of tax returns, a year's worth of bank statement and a year's worth of deposits from PayPal and Venmo and they still denied me. Tiffany once again sent everything over after she went through the file with her manager and said it should go through, again enough income and ratio to debt was good.",1

That is just not acceptable. I will never reuse AmeriSave if this is the same process. I closed back on 15th January and until today, I don't have a single signed document of what I closed. I've emailed them twice.",1

David,"West Chester, OH","Reviewed Feb. 13, 2021","Updated on 02/20/2021: Edit: The company, after seeing reviews, offered to refund me the $500 application fee. I accepted and intended to amend my reviews, but then saw on my closing statement that they'd charged me the $500 fee AGAIN at closing. When I brought this up to the company, they ignored my email for two days, then told me as the notary was standing in front of me that ""the $500 application fee was refunded, but that actually means we make it a closing cost, and since most people roll the closing costs into their loan, they don't have to pay the fee out of pocket."" So they thought they were doing me a favor by putting the $500 fee into my loan...and having me pay interest on it for 30 years. Clearly the company doesn't know what ""refund"" means, and this behavior is borderline fraudulent since they were not upfront with the fee and tried to sneak it into the settlement statement. Shady, shady company. Avoid at all costs.",1

He gave me good recommendations that I ran by people I trust, and they were aligned. There was one time when they had somebody other than Jacob. Somebody who works with the underwriter called me and started asking me to share things. I said I won't tell him. He called Jacob then Jacob called me and said it was all good. I talked to the guy. The lenders that I used when I did my actual buying of my house were nothing compared to what I got from AmeriSave.",5
Robert,"Brownsville, TX","Reviewed Feb. 11, 2021",I was trying to refinance my house. I have my mortgage with Quicken Loans and I contacted them around July. They kept hanging me on until towards the end of November. I got tired and frustrated with them because they kept asking for the same information and just kept me going. At that point was when I saw Amerisave. I called them up and talked to them. I told them the situation I was going through with Quicken Loans. I called up Quicken Loans and told them that I was canceling my application with them and that I was going to start one with AmeriSave. I started working with AmeriSave and they assured me that they could get it done in less than two months. It turned out to be less than two months. It was about seven weeks. We completed within four to five weeks but I felt like it did drag on like an extra week and a half which it didn't need to. ,3

Sean,"York, SC","Reviewed Feb. 10, 2021","I was still trying to finish up the LendingTree forms when I got calls from different lenders. Some of them just continually called at inconvenient times when I told them that I would call them. AmeriSave was the least intrusive one. However, my biggest complaint was the lack of communication. Every time we communicated, I had to reach out to them. I got to the point where I was not hearing anything from them. Phone calls were not returned quickly enough. I got so concerned that it was not legitimate that I went looking at reviews online and I saw a lot of bad reviews from AmeriSave and a lot of miscommunication. I reached out and finally got ahold of a manager who apologized for the lack of communication. They were probably overwhelmed with refinances, given the low rates. But I would have liked to hear that, ""We're still working on this,"" maybe once a week.",3

I signed up way back in October and just ended January. The first kid, Cyrus, quit so I completely lost them. It was like I was out there in the abyss. Somehow Joseph picked my file up and tried to help. But anybody other than Joseph was a nightmare. I had just about given up. We got down to the last 10 days of the six-month lock. It was absolutely crazy. Amerisave had no customer service. Nobody could ever call. You could call and leave a message but you'd never hear back from them that way.

Also, the information was not forthcoming so we were not aware. We were waiting and I had to call her back and see what was going on. And they kept on asking the same questions over and over even though those answers were already given and provided. It looks like there was no communication between the underwriting department and Eileen, who was handling the processing as well. Then, I had to make a lot of noise and be very aggressive to even get to closing. They could improve on their response time and customer service. Other than that, the rate was great.

If there were any little snafu, he was always on top of it. He’d make sure everything was ironed out before it even became an issue. There were some times when another agent would contact me outside of Chris. But that’s to be expected because everybody is keeping tabs on what's going on with the situation.

Daniel,"Jarreau, LA","Reviewed Jan. 27, 2021","I went with Amerisave because the refinance fees, closing and the whole nine yards were all put in the loan but it wasn't marked up like a lot of their competitors. As soon as I got through pretty much with all the paperwork, the company that's been stiff arming me for the past 10 years decided to call me and asked me if I wanted to refinance through them, who I tried to do already but they told me I didn't have enough equity in my home. With Amerisave, I got the appraisal all worked out good. There was plenty of equity. I kind of talked around with other people I know and was trying to get a gauge on the interest rates and I feel happy with the interest rate that I got.",5
Charles,"Tahoe Vista, CA","Reviewed Jan. 27, 2021","I shopped around and AmeriSave had the best rate. The person I spoke with was going to give me 2.65%. There were also minimal fees where it was like $500, $600 in fees by the time all credit got switched on the day before I was supposed to sign. The rep came back and told me that rate was no longer available the day before I was supposed to sign and bumped it up to 2.75%. ",4
Hadi,"Acton, MA","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2021","In the middle of working with my bank to refinance my home, they called me several times and promised to offer the best rate. I uploaded all the required information and documents including our income on day one. I explained the amount of our debt and income and submitted all documents. They told me that my credit score is perfect, and Loan Originator NMLS ID #** told me that even my wife's income is enough. I asked him please review and make sure before the approval because I heard they might want to absorb customers first to get $500 and then check everything. He told me that they reviewed everything, and the application is approved. Then he asked me to pay $500. Once I paid the fee, several times they sent a different loan disclosure, changed numbers like lender credits/ interest rate/ fees, and asked me to sign the new loan disclosure.",1
Kevin,"Hudson, FL","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2021","Overall, the process was fairly smooth and timely. The people that I dealt with provided excellent customer service for the most part and kept us in the loop throughout. There was the occasional hiccup, but nothing that wasn't quickly resolved.

I would recommend Amerisave Mortgage Corporation to anyone that doesn't want the headaches of dealing with banks and the traditional closing process.",5
Greg,"Mountain View, CA","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2021","I knew my credit was good, and I got the rate I asked for. I got 10 different people calling after I put it out there on the internet and the first guy I dealt with, Omar, seemed knowledgeable and persistent, so he got the deal. The process took a couple of weeks only because I dragged it out. It could have been done in 24 hours. I'm happy with AmeriSave. However, when the deal’s all down, they hand it off to a mortgage servicer and I haven’t heard a peep out of that guy. I'm getting a little nervous about that. It's been at least two weeks and I was told I would hear something from them in two or three days.",5

Jimmie,"Belmar, NJ","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2021","Everywhere else I researched, we were being treated like a number, just another mortgage they could put through. The individual I spoke with at AmeriSave had a genuine concern. I learned a lot, which I liked. The online application process was very intuitive and easy to follow. I only had one question one time, which the rep helped me out with. The only thing they could improve on was the uploading of the documents. We had some problems. If only they could speed up that process, or a program that might go a little quicker. The representative was very professional, responsive, knowledgeable, and not afraid to admit that they needed to get back to me. I'm in a customer service business as well selling packaging, and I felt that he had our best interest at hand, and he was always very customer service sensitive, which is really important in that kind of business.",5

Juan,"Riverdale, CA","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2021","To apply and do everything online was simple. The only trouble that I had was sometimes uploading the documents, because I was not good at doing all the new stuff, like making PDF files and other stuff with the documents. But I learned how to do it and it was really simple after that. Then at the beginning when I applied, I didn't put my other houses there. So, later, whenever they got to check the record for all the stuff, they asked me for other paperwork and all the other things. That was the only thing. I have other stuff and I have to report everything that I have, so there was more work to do. Nick, the rep, explained everything from the beginning. I even asked him about the current rates and he was really honest. Any time that he'd email or when I'd email him, he'd always answer. I was satisfied.",5
Rudy,"El Paso, TX","Reviewed Jan. 24, 2021","My experience with AmeriSave initially was good. I had several originators call me each trying to get the sale per se. I was cancelled for asking to get a different originator. I felt uncomfortable with him. Next day I tried both logging online and calling several AmeriSave contacts and no one answered. I guess was tagged or identified for whatever reason by both their phone service and internet login web service not to reply to me. They did not give me a reason why I got cancelled to proceed on with the application. Prior to being cancelled, I explained to another originator my complaint and he was willing to replace him once he emailed his supervisor. Long story short. They cancelled my application without a reason or explanation. Bottom line upfront, Don’t do business with AmeriSave.",1
Robin,"Lithia Springs, GA","Reviewed Jan. 24, 2021","AmeriSave was listed as one of the top four lenders for refinancing with the best rate. I also read the reviews online and I decided to use them. I interacted mostly with the loan officer and the interaction was great. She was very helpful. She explained the process and when we did the application, I told her I would call her back, but she insisted to stay on the phone and go through every page with me. That was a great thing. On the other hand, I got a little uncomfortable with the lawyer that was sent out here. He was a very talkative, nice older guy, but he could have left out some of the conversations. He told me that he used to be a cop who worked around a ** activist. I’m an ** girl, but I don’t have anything against cops. We need cops. ",5

I was doing a lot of Google searching and Amerisave was one of the ones that had the best rates in terms of fees and APR that's why I chose them. My rep, Cory, was great. He was very responsive, quick and to the point. He was very accommodating as well. However, the application and the mortgage online system are kinda like separated. It would be better if they were connected. When I got my application approved from Amerisave, I had to wait another two to three weeks to get my account on the mortgage portal. I had no idea where would I even log in to get my billing statements and set up auto-pay. Cory didn’t know as well or give me any answers on that.",4

It was a lot quicker than he said it was going to be and it took less than two months.

My daughter gave me the broker she was working with at AmeriSave and I called and talked to him. His name was James and I was happy with him. He was really professional and told me what he could get for me at my credit score. I got a good one and I figured the process would be easy. He told me upfront that the loan would take up to 45 days. It's a little longer process because the interest rates are so low and they're having a lot of people do it. I put $500 out and learned it was nonrefundable, so I stuck with them because Quicken said they could beat their rate. ",5

Daniel who was my first contact at AmeriSave and who also wrote the loan could not have made it easier. As an accountant, I ask questions and he was good at answering. To lock in the 2.25 rate that I did was paramount to the whole process. I didn't want to do it but when it got to 2.25, I thought, ""That would do it.""

I would go in there, and it looked like everything was there. I called my loan officer and he said that everything was good. I asked him why I kept getting the emails.

It's not a fun process no matter who the company is, but it is what it is. The only thing that could have gone smoother is if they verified that they had the correct last name before all the documents were filled out, so that there are no problems later on. When they initially called me, they had my maiden name, so when they created the document, my maiden name was on all the documents even though I told them that was my maiden name, not my official last name. They had to go back and change all the documents. Other than that, Christopher was a nice and professional guy. He responded to my questions in a timely manner as well.

It went well with the disclosure sheet and I appreciate getting that upfront with all the terms so I could look at the numbers and then negotiate from there. Sal was the guy that helped me and he was very responsive. I had questions at all times of the day and night and he always responded and if he didn't know, he would get back to me.

One thing to remember is make sure that you have all the necessary and updated information and not partial information as that can hold up the closing. Also review all items you sign so your experience is as good as mine was.",5

At that point, we were going back and forth because I had to check the documents and they weren't right, so they had to send them back up and do it again.

He was the one I dealt with the whole time and I was impressed by his responsiveness. From the moment I reached out to Amerisave to getting the approval, from underwriting it, it was a matter of days.

Overall, I’m happy with the term and the rate because we were on a 30-year conventional and we went to 15. We saved about $90,000 five years off of our existing loan. We weren’t happy about the points, but it’s alright. I wanted the 2% fixed. The only thing we were annoyed with, and it wasn’t Maryanne’s fault, was that when we were doing the paperwork, we sent AmeriSave the page that they needed but they kept insisting on the entire trust agreement.

Joshua,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Jan. 12, 2021","The first person we worked with, Carlos, was amazing. He communicated very well. Was responsive to our emails, texts, and phone calls. He was able to answer most of our questions and if not he got back to us quickly. After our loan was ready for underwriters and handed over to the next loan person the communication fell through the cracks. The service became very spotty. There were times we didn’t get a response to a question in over two weeks. We needed to have our situation pushed up to a supervisor to get things moving again. With the same person. Which ended up having issues again with communication. So overall we are happy with the product and the end result. We are unsure if we would work with this company again strictly based on the poor communication of the second loan officer we worked with.",3
Michael,"Tucson, AZ","Reviewed Jan. 12, 2021","This was the fastest and easiest refinance I have ever gone through. The rates were fantastic and staff was extremely helpful. This was so painless and easy. I almost thought something was wrong. If I had one mild drawback, it would be the closing costs were a little higher than others I shopped. I began my refinance after some of the people I work with were doing their refinance with other companies and Amerisave closed my loan long before my co workers. I would absolutely do business with Amerisave again.",5
Larry,"Kennesaw, GA","Reviewed Jan. 12, 2021",Always kept me informed and the process moved quickly. Everyone I dealt with was very courteous and knowledgeable.

John,"Dennis, MA","Reviewed Jan. 12, 2021","My experience with AmeriSave was great. Adam, the salesperson I dealt with was excellent. We had a couple of snafus with the notary coming to the house and we had to reschedule. Part of it was due to the mortgage being at our summer home, not at our regular home. So they were planning on going to our summer home, which is a good distance away. There was a little bit of a mix-up with that. But it had nothing to do with the job that Adam did for me. He was really good. I appreciated how that went. When the other team came in, it became a little bit more difficult to get that process done. But, Adam stepped in, rescheduled it and got it all cleaned up. He did what he said he was going to do. Right from the get-go, his numbers were on the mark and they proved to be so all the way to the end. That to me is the most important.",4

Since then there has been nothing but constant confusion, delays [on their part], sloppiness and unprofessionalism. We have uploaded the same documents to their portal numerous times. What is happening to these? Are they secure? We think not. We have also dealt with many different people that appear not to communicate with each other. I have no confidence if anyone actually knows what is going on. Email and phone calls are never responded to. Called the customer service number asking to speak to a supervisor and never heard back. Finally we were sent an email stating there was conditional approval from underwriting.",1

Within less than a month, I was able to refinance. The rates were amazing. I didn't pay any fees. For points, I got a 2.5 rate, which I don't think I could ever get lower without paying the points and the closing costs were less than any other time I refinanced. I'm pretty happy with the service of AmeriSave. Overall, it was timely.",5
Yevgeniy,"Livingston, NJ","Reviewed Jan. 10, 2021","AmeriSave's pricing is better than the competition. The reps are helpful, reachable and easy to work with.

He kept calming my nerves down and said that I got this. So I went through. ",5

The loan processor that I first had was terrible. He wouldn't return calls or emails, he wouldn't read emails, and he would ask me for things multiple times. I got Quintin back involved and he made a change, he got a new guy in, Aaron. Once we got Aaron on board, things went smoothly. The rate and terms I got were good.

That was a good experience and so was this. The application and underwriting process wasn't very difficult and it has evolved since the last time with using e-signatures. So that was a whole lot easier because it saved a lot of time. It was great. Bradley, the rep, was professional and thorough as far as product knowledge and knowing what might fit and where to put you. So that comes in handy. The loan officers make a big difference if they're knowledgeable about the product. They listen to the client and accommodate.",5

He talked fast and the connection wasn’t very good.

But we talked some more and he was very persistent in getting back and finding a time that worked for both of us. I found out that he was very educational. So, I liked that.

The agent that I talked to had a lot of knowledge. He was good, quick and efficient.  Everything was wonderful. With a refi, you can lower your payments. If you lower your interest rate more than a point, you can look at how much money you can save. I saved $300 a month and I also cut 30,000 off the length of my loan so it’s not that much paperwork to save so much money.",4

AmeriSave’s quote was the best among the different mortgage providers I connected with. Their closing fees were on the low end, but not the absolute low.

The consultant walked me through things. I'm pleased because the consultant was able to come through with everything that he promised. Even though there were little discrepancies in the middle, he took care of them and made sure it was as he said. He would call or email.

After talking to all the various contacts, she seemed to be the most had-it-together person that I was speaking with. So she being my first impression of the company was very positive, I decided to continue to work with her and certainly, it paid off. The process only took about 60 days and that was providing all the different information. So it actually went a lot faster than I anticipated. But the amount that we got back after the loan was $50 less than my closing documents had indicated. There must be some kind of charge, but I was just trying to figure out what that was. ",5

Anthony,"Oakland, CA","Reviewed Dec. 31, 2020","I had been doing an extensive amount of research on different loan providers. I went through USAA, Veterans United, and somewhere along the search, the algorithm sent me to an ad for AmeriSave. I applied just to have three different options and I got pre-approved by all three. I ended up going with AmeriSave because the interest rate was lower and the approval was actually higher.",5
Timothy,"Brambleton, VA","Reviewed Dec. 31, 2020","I refinanced and the application process was easy. The length of time to close was a little bit more lengthy than I was expecting and wanted it to be. However, I was told that that's because they are inundated with refinances at the moment. Other than that, I was happy with the rate and the term.",4
Ross,"Mountain Home, ID","Reviewed Dec. 30, 2020",I got in touch with was Brittany from AmeriSave and she was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful.

Jim,"Lafayette, GA","Reviewed Dec. 30, 2020","I googled and compared rates from different people and AmeriSave was the best one. The process couldn't have been much more than three weeks from start to finish. They were very fast. I talked to a total of two different representatives and both of them were very helpful and knowledgeable. A lot of it was done by email and the response was almost immediate when I would email them. But when we had a phone conversation, it was just a bad connection on the line. However, as far as communication, they were on the spot anytime I needed to talk to them. Fannie Mae’s got the loan now and somebody else is administering the payment.",5

The two people I worked with, one on the front end and one on the back end that did the closing, were very knowledgeable at what they did, and it was quite refreshing. The rate was right on the market. It was the best opportunity that we found. We have excellent credit. We could have chosen anywhere and we chose them. It was an overall positive experience and we were glad we did it. We're refinanced now.",5
Kenneth,"Monroe, NC","Reviewed Dec. 27, 2020","I was trying to find a better interest rate with the loan I was getting. AmeriSave had the best interest rate than the other banks I've been dealing with. Jonathan was the person I worked with and he did all he could to help me. But I got a little aggravated at times with their procedure for putting stuff in over and over again. I had to do that a couple of times. I gave Jonathan the information and I had to give it to him again. Other than that, Jonathan went all out and I was very pleased with him.",4
Stavin,"White City, OR","Reviewed Dec. 27, 2020","AmeriSave was offering better rates in comparison to other providers. My rep Jeremy was good. There were a couple of times where I was trying to get a hold of him and the underwriter's assistant. Unfortunately, they wouldn't return my calls. They'd finally get back to me some three or four days later. Other than that, Jeremy was great. He was able to work with more money to get rid of PMI. Things ended up working out better out than I thought originally because my house got appraised for more. I'm happy with AmeriSave. Going with them was straightforward and I didn't have to do a lot of work. Everything was through texting and Jeremy made it pretty easy. It was a good experience.",4

From initiating the refinance on Nov 18 to closing on Dec 10, 2020 the process finished in 3 weeks ... which is excellent. The rates were good as well and below the industry. No appraisal was required on the property and fewer documents needed than my last refinance with a more traditional bank.",5

Damond,"College Park, MD","Reviewed Dec. 17, 2020","The total experience was abysmal. At first glance you will think that you are onto something good. But as a wise proverbs says, if it seems too good to be true - it probably is. I worked with Erick Zacarias ** Loan Originator NMLS ID #**, and was essentially provided inaccurate information that lead me to make unwise decisions. This company is more interested in getting you to pay the $500 to start the refi process rather than being completely transparent. Beware of AmeriSave, do more research and use a different lender.",5
Howard,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed Dec. 17, 2020","The rep was very helpful and answered any questions I have. The whole process took two months and it was smooth putting all the documents in the website, which was a little glitchy. The rates were good. Now is a good time to refinance.",5

David,"Tulsa, OK","Reviewed Dec. 16, 2020","We had some home remodeling we wanted to do. I had a bit of equity in the home and interest rates were super low, and I just thought it was a good time to get a mortgage. AmeriSave's online application process was easy. I was skeptical about it. And I had people tell me, “You should just go to a local bank.” But a lot of times, you have to open accounts with the bank you're going through, and the rate didn't appear to be as low. So, I took a risk and gave it a shot. You fill out one of those interest kind of things, and you start getting responses from everybody under the sun. That part was a little annoying. But it was good to be able to compare rates. It was easy to do research online about the different companies. I was always a little skeptical about things of that size online.",5
Gary,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed Dec. 15, 2020","We had a couple of lenders very interested in our business, but AmeriSave provided the lowest rate and such an easy process.

John,"Encinitas, CA","Reviewed Dec. 15, 2020","Well, after months of this process, the latest loan processor was able to get this to the stage for me to meet with a notary. The problem though is they updated my loan estimate today and once again increased my discount points. I can't help but think this is a shady move since they did this a month back and expected me to sign off on it. Amerisave agreed to fix this if I did not abandon the loan, but took them many days to rectify it but their first fix was still higher than the agreed upon %. Now, just as we are going to sign tomorrow, they changed the points again today! How can you trust this company? They say the right things and are mighty polite, but beware! If they tried this on you, please note it so no one else gets burned!",1
Belkis,"Hackensack, NJ","Reviewed Dec. 15, 2020","I found AmeriSave online. I filled out an application. And then, I called them. The person that I spoke with was very helpful and knowledgeable so I felt that he helped me out. Everything was online. They created a profile where you scan and then where we communicated on on both ends, so it was very simple and easy to do the transactions. It took around 60 days, but it was because the market was so high. I know a lot of people were doing it so they were a little backed up, and they had a lot of applications coming in. The reps explained that it took longer than they usually take. But it was not only them. It’s everyone. And it's the situation that we're in right now. I feel good. They were very easy to contact. We had great communication back and forth, so it was a great experience for me.",5

James,"Gilbert, AZ","Reviewed Dec. 13, 2020","It took 8 weeks to close my loan, which was frustrating. I attributed it to the processors being quite busy with all the refi's due to historically low rates. I have only made one payment, but so far, so good. I really like my lower rate and payment.

It was the simplest of all applications that we've ever done for any mortgages. The reps were great and we were comfortable with them. We kept getting a regeneration of them requesting something that we already gave them but it was better. An email was sent out and evidently, it was automatic because whoever programmed the computer didn't think that we were gonna be getting it down so fast.",5

The application process took less than a week. But the whole process from selecting a home to closing was 40 something days so I thought it was pretty good.

It was exceedingly more difficult to get any kind of relevant information from him as the time went on. I had to engage the customer service team who were absolutely FANTASTIC.

I know this is was a super rapid response because, when I complained about the slow pace of the process to the notary who came to the closing, he told me this was actually super fast. He pointed out that, in his experience, the usual timeframe to closing was 5 or 6 months due to the massive overload of applicants during this time of ultra-low interest rates. He helped me to understand how AmeriSave responded to my urgency and got the job done for me in record time.",5

The other was that the website was connected to automated text messages. Every time something would happen on the backend, it would send me a message saying that more documents were needed from me and I would get super confused. Other than that, the rep was very good.

The person I worked with was really open and he kind of advised me the best way to move forward. For the underwriting, I was not that happy with it. I didn't get a lot of communication. I did have to check back with them every time. And as far as the closing, there were a lot of goof-ups. That was something that I wasn't very happy with AmeriSave. But eventually, they did fix everything and they responded to my emails. I'm glad that it worked out.",3
D.,"Hi, HI","Reviewed Dec. 6, 2020","I was on the Bankrates.com website and looking at rates and AmeriSave came up as a competitive rate. I started an application on getting transferred out of that site and I was not sure how to answer some of the things on the application. As I paused it, the phone rang, and it was Jennifer from AmeriSave on the line, and she helped me finish up that initial part of the application. Once things were going, I had a little bit trouble getting human contact and I had to actually threaten to just stop the whole thing seemingly to get a human response. I got that and eventually, it went through in a reasonably timely manner. I hope there would be more prompt response to questions that arise in the early phases of the process. I'm very happy with the rates and terms I got.",4

I told them that if they don't give me an answer that week, I would start finding another one. That's what happened. The APR was lower at that time so I consulted two or three mortgage companies and they were a little higher. AmeriSave didn’t ask me for too much requirements. They said I only have to pay two of my debts to qualify. Other banks were telling me that I needed to pay off all my debts. I already refinanced three times during my time that I have the house and it was the best and fastest. I emailed back the loan and it was answered really fast. I had a good experience with AmeriSave.",5

He is in a supervisor role now so he sent me to somebody else and we started talking.

They were slow and I had to get an appraiser on my own because they weren't able to find one for my area. Then the closing title company was terrible, rude, and didn't respond to either Chris or me or several other people. They put our file in with a lady that couldn't work remotely.

There was a lengthy demand for information but we got through one. But the other one is still ongoing and it hasn't come to conclusion. It'll be about two and a half months now. That's a lengthy process. We dealt with the initiator and the processors. The notary that came to the house was a very nice lady and she's very efficient. The rate and terms we received were what we could get. It was favorable. Overall, the guys from Amerisave are good people to work with. I perceive them to be intelligent and people of integrity.

From what I understand it's farmed out to a separate entity and then whoever can take it, takes it. We got a couple of emails saying it was going to be this guy but then it turned out to be this other person. The person who showed up to do that was fine but there was nothing alarming about them.",4
Robert,"Ontario, CA","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020","The application was smooth. The process was straightforward. The process of doing it online was excellent.

Right now, the way everybody's refinancing, the process is a little longer than normal. It normally takes three to four weeks. But I was pleased with the service in which they handled it. Whenever I called, they returned my calls. Whenever they needed something, they let me know. The two individuals that actually did it were phenomenal and outstanding. When I told them what I wanted to do, they were able to process it in a timely manner. The biggest hang-up was the processor on that end. Whenever I email them or I call them, they call me right back within the day. ",4

I enjoyed that and that the reason why I would recommend AmeriSave to others. ,5
Mohssen,"Glendale Heights, IL","Reviewed Dec. 2, 2020","I shopped around and AmeriSave’s price was less than others. Everything was online, through messaging and emails, and signing electronically. It was okay. I had my documents ready and I sent anything they needed. The first guy I was talking to was good. He explained to me all things in detail. I called him anytime I needed something and he answered and helped. I was looking at maybe a $210,000 loan and I ended up doing 211-something, maybe because AmeriSave was not clear on my last monthly payments to the other lender. I was told to not pay and maybe they ended up paying that and added that to my loan. So, that was the only one that I did not like but I'm okay. Two days ago, I sent the officer to see if AmeriSave can send me my closing documents and nobody answered me back.

After 4 months I found another company who completed the whole mortgage process in 4 weeks. Save your $500 and avoid the months of frustration listening to lies, go anywhere but Amerisave.

Out loan processor kept asking for more and more after she said everything was okay. As soon as I mentioned that it was getting annoying, they switched to someone else. Other than that, the response was still quick and we were very happy. My caveat would be to make sure that you'd have a competent loan originator.

The process and the loan processor that I got was great. Adam was very responsive, knowledgeable, on top of things and very client service-oriented. He did an outstanding job. The problem that I faced was with the title company that AmeriSave worked with. It was an absolutely awful process with them. The closing was rescheduled about five times. It was unheard of.

He said, “Let's meet tonight.” I did have a friend who met with me and him by way of the internet in terms of submitting the application process, after which, it took about a month for someone to get back to me. That was on the heels of me calling AmeriSave customer service because I was never given a customer service point of contact.

When I went out and looked, AmeriSave was the first one that mentioned 2.5% for 30 years and I went for it. Since I'm going to be here for another 30 years, I would pay a few points and it would take me a couple years to pay those back but after that, it's going to be clear savings. Our first original purchase was horrendous with the amount of questions and more research that I had to do to find things for them.

Toon,"Glendale, CA","Reviewed Nov. 10, 2020","Amerisave was very responsive to my needs. They made the process virtually effortless. The staff was great to work with. Even though they had some staffing changes during the process, everyone picked up the work and got us to the finish line. Would work with them again.",5
Debbie,"Hillsboro, OH","Reviewed Nov. 10, 2020",Chartrice ** was wonderful. She helped me with everything along the way being sure I had no questions. The process was fairly easy to go thru and it made it easy to have someone come to my house for the closing.,5
Keith,"Columbia, MD","Reviewed Nov. 10, 2020","Everyone from AmeriSave was great to work with. They were really helpful and got back to me in an acceptable timeframe. I went with AmeriSave because of the posted rates at the time that I was investigating. There was a lot of communication with the loan originator and providing all the documentation that was needed. That was the major part of putting it together. But the online component was a little bit flaky. I wasn't ever alerted when new information was needed from me. I would check often. But then in a couple of instances, information was needed quickly and I wasn't alerted until someone texted me or emailed me. Overall, it went pretty well. I'm happy with how everything went and the terms and rates.",5
Tifaqur,"Washington, DC","Reviewed Nov. 10, 2020","Everything went great. It took a little long initially but I understand, with the flood of people trying to refinance. The interest rate was better and then it afforded me the opportunity to lower my monthly payment. I'm very satisfied. The rep that I had was very good. I really appreciated him. Trevor was pretty speedy on responses. Then at the end, it was a gentleman named Bob. They were both great. The online application was pretty good. It was easy to fill in the information. I had an overall great experience. This was my first time refinancing. But based off everything I've heard from other people, mine went pretty simple.",5
Robert,"Newport News, VA","Reviewed Nov. 10, 2020","I went online and Amerisave had the highest rating. They did the most business and had the best customer satisfaction so I contacted them. The person that did our initial contact was good. But I kept getting all of these requests that they needed something and specifically, my insurance. I contacted the insurance company again. My insurance company said they had already sent what Amerisave was asking. I asked him several times before he finally stopped sending me that email. That was a bit confusing. The online application was cumbersome. It did not flow well. There was back and forth and back and forth. If they copy what Quicken Loans does, it's much easier and more seamless.",3
Charles,"Waterbury Center, VT","Reviewed Nov. 10, 2020","My wife was looking for opportunities to refinance and the terms that AmeriSave appeared to be offering were a good match. As we began to talk with them, the individual that was helping us at the other end was especially good and helpful. The online application is always a bit of a hassle, but it's probably superior to having to do all the face-to-face contacts. The application and underwriting took from August to November, roughly, and it seemed like forever because of the sheer volume that the business was involved at that particular time. But the service that we got and the responsiveness was really outstanding.",5
Viswanath,"Ashburn, VA","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2020","I started my refinance process with Amerisave in early July. I started with Amerisave after talking to one of their representatives and foolishly believing in his promises of prompt responses, closing this in August and getting a floating interest rate in case the interest rates go down before closing. I also paid $500 upfront as per their rules. It's 4 months since then and there is no sign of a closing date yet. I'm stuck with the $500 that I already paid. Also the interest rates have fluctuated and gone down since then and no word about reducing the interest rate even after me asking them several times. I just wanted to move on if they refund my amount, but they Never Ever entertained any conversations about my refund and let me go even after me asking them so many times. ",1
Ashok,"East Lansing, MI","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2020","They have offered me best interest rates in market. Even though couple of other lenders offering same rate, Amerisave has low monthly PMI amount, which made my overall monthly payment way less than competitors.

Catherine,"Powhatan, VA","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2020","We locked in at a great rate and were able to close in 15 days! Adam ** was most helpful in going over everything with me.

Philip,"Marietta, GA","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2020","I used AmeriSave Mortgage before and was satisfied with the service, so I called up to lower the rate that I had. I talked to a local loan originator here. He was very professional and very helpful. He walked me through the process quite well, told me what information I needed, and kept me up-to-date pretty much as the loan went through. I had one little hiccup but not too bad of one. I was not made aware that I had to have somebody to witness the loan that was not a family member. So, I had to scramble at the end. With the coronavirus, it was a little more difficult to find somebody that could come over in a hurry, but we managed. The rate that I got from AmeriSave was probably the best one that I saw. Overall, I'm very pleased.",5
David,"Hoover, AL","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2020","AmeriSave was wonderful. I applied for refinancing and they had something that was a bit of a problem, but their system and their customer service people were were fabulous. I always say, ""The measure of how good a company is, is not when everything works perfectly, but when you have to deal with something that doesn't work perfectly."" They stepped right up to the plate, solved the problem, and made everything work the way it's supposed to. They did a fantastic job. The rates and terms turned out very well too. We're at two and a quarter percent and the fees were fair. We were very pleased with the whole service.",5
Victor,"Hudson, NH","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2020","It's been great with Amerisave. When I called, I spoke with a gentleman named Drew. He was very concise and clear. He gave me a very good description on how everything was gonna be coming down. Whatever question I had, I called Drew and he answered the phone. I sent him an email and he answered right away. The rate was very competitive too. I checked with all the lenders and they couldn't match it. I talked to Rocket Mortgage and they said that Drew gave me a good deal.",5
Robert,"Weeki Wachee, FL","Reviewed Nov. 9, 2020","When I first started with the refinance with AmeriSave, I was dealing with John for a little over a month. The last time I spoke to John was on the 23rd of September and then he turned me over to Melissa. That was when everything fell apart. I realized right after I got off the phone that I had a couple of very pertinent questions that I wanted to ask. So on the 24th of September, I called Melissa's number that John had given to me. She never called back. So I called on the 25th and left a message and she never called back. Then there was a weekend, Saturday and Sunday, I didn't call.",4

Mary,"St. Petersburg, FL","Reviewed Nov. 8, 2020","The AmeriSave ratings looked good. I just wanted to get a second opinion, and I'm glad I did. Brian was very knowledgeable. I work at a global company, 24/7, and him being in Hawaii was very helpful because I could get in touch with him in the evening hours so that was cool. He advised me in the right way. It all worked out from the beginning to the end just as he said. The application to underwriting took only about a month, which, to me, was short, considering everything that's going on. ",5
Roderick D,"Sparks, NV","Reviewed Nov. 8, 2020","The process went smoothly and was easy to do online. Their portal made it easy to sign and upload forms.

Manotha,"Herndon, VA","Reviewed Nov. 8, 2020","We did a refinance with AmeriSave five years ago and had a very good experience. That's the reason why we went with AmeriSave again when we purchased our home property. In 2015, I worked with a person who I liked. He moved up the ladder but he still told me to fill out the application and they would definitely take care of it. I started working with a gentleman called Frederick and he was really nice. I was the one interacting with him and he explained so many things that I was not even aware of it. I had a very pleasant experience. He’s one of the best I have worked with ever. The rates are pretty good and better than other companies. We tried to get quotes from different companies but I always had AmeriSave on my mind. I don’t mind working with the person I liked during our first interaction. Everything went well.",5
Debra,"Lindenwold, NJ","Reviewed Nov. 8, 2020",My loan with AmeriSave took almost four months which is a while longer than I expected. There was always a document that needed to be done right before closing. I needed to prove another document all of the sudden. And it seemed to happen every month. We needed another pay stub because it had already been over 30 days. But I had no problem dealing with the online application and the underwriting. That was fine. That part was easy. It was just a little difficult during this COVID thing because I'm on shift work. It was easier for me to do the paperwork when I was here at work than when I was home because I don't have access to a computer. But everything is finally done. ,3
Jeffrey,"Batesville, IN","Reviewed Nov. 8, 2020","I talked to one of the reps, Josh, and he kinda convinced me it might be the right thing to do.

Brian,"Walla Walla, WA","Reviewed Nov. 7, 2020","Everything went really well with AmeriSave but they could improve with their ability to communicate effectively. That was because I wasn't prepared when I initially talked to the person that did my loan, and then correcting some incorrect information along the way became really cumbersome to deal and getting ahold of him. But I'm also assuming that they are swamped. I'm a reasonable person. I can see where somebody who is not reasonable might complain about that. But I'm very satisfied with the company. When I did follow up with other people related to their company, people were really responsive and got me through the process. Their automated system, for whatever reason, kept sending me requests for information that I had already sent in. So, it needs some refining to do what they expect it to do.",4

In a time where things are crazy, there's a little sanity in the craziness.",5
Thomas,"Hillsboro, VA","Reviewed Nov. 7, 2020","The process seemed to be fairly trouble-free. AmeriSave got some glitches 'cause they've got a web portal that I go to for submitting documents.

Otherwise, their customer service was fine. Other than the initial phone call, everything else was done online, like via email, with very little human contact.

We didn't know what the process was. We didn’t know if something was going on. There was no communication, which was crucial for us because we didn’t know enough about the progress of the loan.

But the people on the other side were very willing to help me and walk me through it. So we got it done. But maybe they could explain a little better when working with older people.

Michael,"Haverhill, MA","Reviewed Nov. 4, 2020","I refinanced through AmeriSave. They had a lower rate and they're a better provider. I found that the people that I had to work with and the online portal where they asked for documents were very easy to keep track of everything and easy to know what you've sent and what you haven't sent. It was a fairly straightforward process. The points were a little high, but the rate was fine. Overall, it was a very easy experience.",5
Abdiel,"Cumming, GA","Reviewed Nov. 4, 2020","AmeriSave Mortgage had a very competitive interest rate and their website to apply for a loan was easy to use. The online process was very straightforward, very user-friendly and a lot easier than expected. Overall, the experience was great on that part. There was a time there that I had a little concern because apparently, the person that I was working with had a family emergency. It would’ve been appropriate for me to know that there was gonna be a delay on that because, for about a week, it was just silence. I thought that they might have ghosted me. So, they had a manager take over for a little bit until things were situated. That could’ve been handled a little better. Other than that, yeah, everything went well.",4

They were answering my questions and were available so I went with them. I was surprised that the process was as easy as it was ‘cause I'm not good with paperwork. It's like a different language to me when I read what I’m supposed to do. It’s not something I'm comfortable with but this one was unbelievably easy.",5
Colonel (R) Dave,"Fernandina Beach, FL","Reviewed Nov. 3, 2020","Applied for a streamlined VA IRRL loan on Sep 2, 2020. As of today, Nov 2, 2020, the rate is not locked and the process has no end in sight. Worst customer service in the industry. The loan originator (Mark ** in Plano, TX) promised at the outset that the entire process would take 4-6 weeks and that he would lock my rate. He lied. He floated the rate. He sent me the same email twenty-one times - just to make it look like the loan was processing. It wasn't. Then he asked me to post date a document (dated Dec 1st, 2020) changing my homeowner's insurance. I refused. I finally raised my concerns with Patrick Markert, CEO of Amerisave (p******.m******@amerisave.com). One of his flunkies called me and told me my loan had already been canceled by the originator (Mark **), but I'd have to post-date my homeowners insurance documents in order to re-instate the application. I refused.",1
Mile,"Caldwell, NJ","Reviewed Nov. 3, 2020","I was trying to lower the interest rate. I had a 3.5 and AmeriSave offered a 2.5, and there were quite a lot of savings. It was pretty easy to apply for refinancing with them, given the fact that everything was done online. Their system was quite easy to use and the loan originator that I worked with, Muhammad, was very easy to work with, explaining things and answering emails. We only had a couple of phone calls, so that was convenient as well. Everything was covered by the loan originator and it was a pretty straightforward process. The rates and terms were great. They gave me what they promised. Also, the closing was said to be done within 45 days, and we did this within 40 days or so. So, everything was done on time. Two weeks ago, the original loan was paid off and the account had already been set up. So I'm good to go from December on.",5

I sent in copies of most of the needed forms and I got approved. The process took three weeks but the reason it took a little long was that I didn't send in one of the forms needed. With the callbacks that I was doing, I never got a hold of a live person but they did get back to me. AmeriSave needs to answer their phones better.

However it took over 100 days to close, which was definitely excessive. When it got down to the loan processor, the lady didn't answer quite so well. I started to get a little frustrated because we were going on 100 days.

I've called, emailed and texted everyone for whom I have contacts - no response. I've called and begged for my loan to be transferred to another associate - they wouldn't do it. It has taken so long, they had to run my credit a second time and did so without even telling me. I got a notification from a credit monitoring agency that it had been pulled again. Stay away from these guys unless you have endless amounts of time and don't mind your credit being pulled multiple times at random.",1
Paulette,"Seneca, SC","Reviewed Nov. 2, 2020","This mortgage company is the most incompetent lender I have ever dealt with. Took over 3 months to close a very easy loan - blame game, we're so busy, Covid, etc. Instead of a checklist of necessary information, they ask you for documents in a piece meal fashion. Today this, tomorrow that, for 3 months. Unnecessarily time consuming and they were easily confused. Asked for a tax return but couldn't understand it. Asked for documents already submitted. Rarely gave you truthful information. Communication is terrible. Try to reach a supervisor? Impossible! Once they have your money you're stuck. Even scheduled the closing and no one showed up! There are too many lenders out there who value customer service and have some level of competence. Definitely not this one!",1
Eriberto,"Mcdonough, GA","Reviewed Nov. 2, 2020","The only problem was the communication part from the loan processor. They didn't respond to any of my phone calls or emails.

I have a previous experience where it took only like a month to refinance. This one took like two months. But it wasn't a big deal. Then, AmeriSave has one of the best rates. The experience overall was okay.",5

Jeffrey,"Columbia City, IN","Reviewed Nov. 1, 2020","We wanted to lock in a lower rate, which was why we looked into a mortgage. We researched on the internet and AmeriSave had good reviews. Also, we liked the cost. We contacted them online and we got all the information. We went through the steps that they had online and getting the process started went well. Then, it went into underwriting. It came back out of underwriting and everything was good to go. But I was getting a bunch of texts and none of the persons ever put their name on them so we had trouble figuring out who said what and when. When the closing person came out to close it, they had three different dollar amounts that we were supposed to pay. They picked up the phone and called somebody on their end and we ended up not paying the proper closing cost. It just got distributed last week. ",2

I would’ve liked a faster response to some of the emails but there’s only so much you can do with COVID going on. I got a 2.25% rate which was the lowest they offered me based on the credit score between my wife and I. I was pretty happy with that.

I worked with their rep Josh and he was a nice and knowledgeable guy. If he wasn't available to pick up the phone, he would call me back. If I email him, he would reply right away. In a little over 30 days, the process was complete. The rate I got was much lower than what I originally had. AmeriSave is great. They'll find a way to help their customers. If they can't, customers will know right off the bat. I've already referred them to a few people who are currently getting their loans refinanced.",5
Ryan,"Ormond Beach, FL","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2020","I used AmeriSave previously on a refinance and it went very smoothly. I worked with Drew, the loan originator, and he was excellent. I first reached out to him at the end of July and closed at the end of October. It took a while. When I used AmeriSave again, they had a whole lot of new employees because of how many refinances there are and not everyone's qualified very well. Drew did more than his own job. He had to do the loan processor's job as well because she was not good at it at all. There was a lack of communication. I was supposed to have a closing date a couple of times but they didn't get the paperwork done right. It was not as smooth. Otherwise, I'm happy with the rate and terms.",3
Ted,"Vienna, VA","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2020",I like the low fees and the rates that AmeriSave had. It was a good combination. The process was easy and quick. It was very easy to upload documents and what we needed on their automated system. They did a good job of contacting us when something changed. There were a couple of things that came up along the way. We had to add a disclosure document and that was all really pretty painless. The process took something like 30 days which was plenty of time. We weren’t in a big hurry. AmeriSave did a great job of delivering what they said they could deliver so we're happy with it.,5
Corinne,"Atascadero, CA","Reviewed Oct. 24, 2020","Sometimes there was a few glitches on the website, but otherwise, the process was pretty good. The online application process was pretty straightforward. But sometimes, there was confusion that the loan officer would ask my documents. I'd post it online or I’d send stuff to him, and then the online platform would require it. But it worked pretty well. My agent got switched a couple times, but the people I worked with were good.",4
Justin,"Dunwoody, GA","Reviewed Oct. 23, 2020","AmeriSave came back with the lowest interest rate when I googled refinancing and I called. Their online application process was one of the easiest processes that I've ever been through in terms of anything related to a mortgage. Also, the reps were incredibly responsive and I felt very comfortable working with the rep I was paired with. The points and stuff were a little high but I felt justified by the rate being lower. It still worked out better than a lot of the rates I was looking at. It's a very easy process and very quick turnaround.",5
Dustin,"Elizabeth, CO","Reviewed Oct. 23, 2020","I just did a refinance with AmeriSave. I searched them and then filled out the online application. It was fairly simple. There was a time I was unable to download some documents. It said I had some documents to review or sign, but I was unable to. Otherwise, everything was pretty good. The two people I worked with online were good. The person I worked with was very helpful. And then, the lady that came out for the closing did a good job. The rate and terms was one of the better ones I got. I would recommend AmeriSave.",4
Jose,"Hollister, CA","Reviewed Oct. 22, 2020","I started getting letters from different finance companies. I got a call from another company. I wanted to see if they could get me down from 3.25. The guy said that the best he could give me was 2.35. That's at least a point. Three days later, I got a call from AmeriSave. The person said they could get me down to 2.25 and would lock it down so that would cease. That was even better. I went for it as I haven't signed anything on the other company. We started with the procedure and everything went through.",5
Bruce,"Olathe, KS","Reviewed Oct. 22, 2020","When we refinanced with AmeriSave, it was a long process and their automatic robot sending information and questions was totally unnecessary. I called the rep, David, 20 times to ask him why I was getting certain messages and he would tell me to just ignore them and he would take care of it. So, that was aggravating to keep getting these messages that really did not pertain to the process that we were going through.",2
Jason,"Des Moines, WA","Reviewed Oct. 21, 2020",It was my first time refinancing and the process took a month and a half. The rep from AmeriSave got back to me whenever I had a question.

Daniel,"Zachary, LA","Reviewed Oct. 21, 2020","We refinanced with AmeriSave and the process was not difficult, but it took a lot longer than we had anticipated. The entire process took about 90 days from start to finish. It was very tedious and when we initially signed up, we locked in a really great rate that we wanted to keep. But at the end, they came back and said that in order to keep that rate, we had to pay several more points. So that was disappointing. The upfront fees that were initially stated ended up being inflated on the backside. We went from the closing cost being about $1,400 originally quoted, to about 15,000 in the end. That was a substantial hit, in order to keep that interest rate.",4
Colton,"Clarkston, WA","Reviewed Oct. 20, 2020","They had a system error on their end which caused the process to go on for an extra 2 months.

Paul,"Connell, WA","Reviewed Oct. 20, 2020","I'm a news junkie so I knew that the rates were down, and I wanted to see what I could do. I was looking online on my phone and came across AmeriSave. I was able to do everything on my phone to get things started. The online process, such as the application and underwriting, was very good and I liked it. I've only been in this particular house that I refinanced for a year now so I was able to compare it to conventional way of financing and found AmeriSave to be easy compared to having to go down to an office. I live 40 miles out from where I would have to go in and so, they sent out a notary public to do all the final paperwork in my home for the closing, which was convenient. The refinancing is still so new although my wife made an early payment already. So far, I'm very happy. Everything went very well and I’m very satisfied with the experience with AmeriSave.",5
Steve,"Ocoee, FL","Reviewed Oct. 20, 2020","The online application process was easy and good. It just took a step and I have no complaints. The whole process wasn't long but when you got to call the HOA and they needed certain things or asking for the numbers of some people, that took the longest. As a customer, we're paying for the services and they should find these numbers, not ask us for them. But it wasn't a big deal and everything went smoothly. I had a couple of different people reaching out to me, but the person I was speaking to the most was Salvatore with whom I did the application with. There was also a lady named Stevie who was helping me and she followed up on everything. Every time I called or texted her, she would respond to me and it was pretty quick. In the end, the outcome was what I expected and the numbers they gave me were the numbers that I got.",5
Steven,"Lafayette, CO","Reviewed Oct. 19, 2020","Thoughtful and nice, their system can take all the interactions, we just need upload the documents of what the loan required, the agent is very nice and thoughtful, and it saved my monthly payment and first two months payment.

Michele,"Clifton, NJ","Reviewed Oct. 19, 2020","I was refinancing my current mortgage and the rates were really low. After shopping around with a couple of different lenders, I wound up going with the offer that AmeriSave provided. They gave me the best rate. I was impressed by how fast the application was processed. I just wish they could have little communication. I had to follow up a few times to check on the status. But it was not a big deal because everything was processed quickly. The person I worked with was great. Whenever I would reach out to him, he would respond and provide all the information I would request. I'm pretty satisfied with the whole process. Everything went seamlessly.",5
Eric,"Windham, NH","Reviewed Oct. 19, 2020","The application process with AmeriSave was simple and quick to do. So, I was happy about that. The application and underwriting process took a week. It was very fast. The web portal was a good tool to have, and was easy for me to log into and see if there's anything that I have to take care of. So, it allowed me to keep track and stay on top of things, and keep the process moving. I've just gone through the refinance process about eight months prior at a higher rate. So I was fairly familiar and my only questions were about the mechanics of how the process would work through AmeriSave. Rafael, the rep I worked with, was able to explain it to me very clearly and kept me informed of things as they progressed. It was painless.",5
Cynthia,"Naperville, IL","Reviewed Oct. 18, 2020","We got a 30-year fixed loan program from AmeriSave. We did the credit app online, paid for the appraisal online, put a deposit down, and then it took a while for the underwriters to get everything together and approved. Once it was all approved, the closer came over to our house and closed here. We had a home equity loan with our house and they never disclosed that that would have to get closed so that was a major issue after closing. The title company told us about it. I called the underwriter and they reiterated the same thing so then we had to come up with 13,000 out of pocket to put towards that. It would have been all alleviated if I was told upfront about it. But everything else was fine. The rates I received were fair. AmeriSave streamlined everything pretty well. I know that it took longer than expected, but the whole country is trying to do refi, so I get that.",4

We started in late July, getting our broker, Byron, all the information, and then everything was ready to go. There was just a little bit of a backlog which took about an extra two or three weeks because everyone was refinancing. The process took about two and a half months.",5

When it got close to the end, I had some questions right up to the day before closing. They were willing to even put in extra time to make sure they could answer my questions. Because due to COVID, my work was fluctuating during that time. I was off work doing the normal work hours and I was working at night. But they were able to talk to me, to make sure that I was confident before closing happened. So, I really appreciated that effort.",5

Luckily, the guy from Amerisave called me back and said that he really wanted to help me out. He gave me a way better price so I went with them. They were good. The process is streamlined.

Danielle,"White Post, VA","Reviewed Oct. 15, 2020","The rates were low so I figured I would check out refinancing options. AmeriSave gave me the best rates and the cheapest closing fees. They asked me for documents that I would need to send to underwriting to be approved, so they could check my credit. They also asked the same thing with my husband. Once we sent all that information in, it was pretty smooth sailing. We had to wait for them to check on things, check employment and verify a lot. But, they did it in a timely manner. They were always available every time that I had questions or if I didn't agree with something or I just needed to talk things through so I could understand it better. The mortgage rate was good and the fees seemed pretty reasonable. I'm saving almost $300 a month because of them. They did a great job and I would certainly recommend them to anybody.",5

My first home purchase was back in probably late 70s, early 80s. I've had several transactions since then, bought some houses, and this one was by far the easiest process. You can do it online then somebody will contact you and they'll send you all the forms and get you to send in all the information. They'll follow it up and before you know it, you'll get all your docs ready for review and signature then they send a person up to your house to do the signing.

It's like, “The heck, I’m not dealing with these other people anymore.” He was friendly and very informative. He got me a good deal and explained everything. I'm pretty versatile with the computer, so it was really easy to get documents and upload them. It all worked out really well. I don’t like filling out forms but everything seems straightforward. AmeriSave is a big enough company, at least, I’ve heard it. I was drawn to them, so I called. They did have really good rates, and so it worked out.",5

It took a long time to get to underwriting but I didn’t feel like I was being pushed off and pushed off or slowed down.

He gave me my options and we went back and forth then finally decided on a plan moving forward. Hector did give us the option of floating our interest rate in the hopes that it would go down so there was about a two or three-week lag time where nothing was happening. But the interest rates did go down and Hector reached out to me. We locked in our rates and once it got locked in, it was pretty quick. I was overall impressed. There's been a lot of activity with refinancing and everybody's super busy but I didn't feel like I was wasting anybody's time. I still felt like an important customer so that's good.",5

Then, AmeriSave processed my application. Before I went with them, I had a 4% interest rate on a 30-year mortgage. I was able to get 2.625% for 30 years and end up saving almost $500 a month. ",5

James, our rep, did a phenomenal job. Even though he was states away, he answered questions at all hours. I highly recommend him. AmeriSave was great and I was happy with their service.

I had started down the path with a couple of other lenders but we got to that stumbling block of not meeting my numbers. I stood back and waited until I could find somebody who did. When I told Amerisave what my target was, they beat that. I couldn't get other lenders to beat the total package and that's what prompted me to go ahead and pull the trigger on the deal. I had a target savings I was looking for and I had a target amount that I was willing to spend. They also beat the closing cost and it worked out.",5

This tells me that AmeriSave is always looking to improve their services. Bradley answered all of my questions and responded in, quick time, any additional information I requested.

It would then take another week before something else was needed. The processing part of it became drawn out.

Everything went through almost flawlessly on us. My wife did not have any problems with the application process. I was surprised then how smoothly it went. I'd recommend AmeriSave.",5
Chris,"Bluffdale, UT","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2020","I was looking at refinancing in general. A 30-year. I didn’t know when I did it that it was through LendingTree. I also didn't realize that the amount of responses would be flooded. It was a little much at first. But with AmeriSave, it was good. Leah was really great to work with. She was my mortgage person that we worked with directly. Very helpful and nice. From start to finish, right from talking to them for the first time all the way to close, it was a little longer than three months. Also, we were pleased with the rate. It was a lower one and I don't feel the fees or anything were unreasonable. We had a good experience. I had other family reach out to us who we had used so I recommended them to try AmeriSave.",5
Devin,"Gainesville, TX","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2020","I was on LendingTree and I put in I wanted to refinance. When I did that, I got a call from the agent of AmeriSave and he helped me through the whole deal. I went with a refinance with cash-out and the process was really easy. However, it took a while 'cause we're in the situation where everything's taking longer, but it was fine. Everything was handled well. Our agent was very helpful and great. The rates and terms of the mortgage were real good. They were the same as what we had before.",5
Todd,"Henderson, NV","Reviewed Sept. 25, 2020","AmeriSave was a little more responsive when talking on the phone and we ended up clicking. And they seemed to be better. However, obtaining the mortgage was a pain in the butt. It was just a lot of forms. AmeriSave had to have 12 months of payments from my girlfriend’s part of it. So, the income had to be adjusted. And then, I gave them 11 months, but they wouldn't do it without the 12th month, so I had to wait an extra month. I get it, it’s the law, but it was just frustrating. But it really wasn't AmeriSave’s fault.",4
Alexander,"Rockville, MD","Reviewed Sept. 25, 2020","I did refinancing with AmeriSave before. Recently, I decided to go with a 30 years fixed loan with them. They have a good process. I'm reasonably happy. They did everything. There were some delays but not big ones so everything worked out fine. All interactions were online. They place a task there for me to complete, like a couple of some documents or they will send emails with questions or answers to my questions. So it was very good and very fast.",5
Kevin,"Wellman, TX","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2020","I refinanced due to the lower interest rates that are going on right now. I did a bit of shopping around online. I came across AmeriSave, and they were really helpful through the process. With my last experience, I had to do it all in person and it was a lot more hectic. But recently, the most resounding aspect of it was to be able to do it online and not have to be somewhere in person, because I live 55 miles from a big city. I didn't need to provide many documents since it was a refinance. It was like transferring some of the things I already had, except for appraisal. I had to do another appraisal and normal steps of a mortgage. You had to show your income, last bank statements, and all the various qualification forms. It just fell into place.",5
Jason,"Union, NJ","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2020","I was comparing rates. I did an online application which went to several different lenders. AmeriSave Mortgage gave me the best numbers, so I went with them. Overall, everything was pretty smooth. I'm doing my investment property now. I have the two homes with AmeriSave. I just did my primary last month and I should be closing soon on my investment property. The first one went pretty smooth. I know right now it's a very busy time for mortgage people, so sometimes it was difficult, but you don't get called back as fast as you would expect. But I understand that due to the times and the workload that they got, it's taking a bit longer than expected. ",5
Gabriel,"Riverview, FL","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2020","I received a lot of refinancing offers by mail and decided to look into who should I go for. I read some good reviews about Amerisave. After a $500 fee, I’m writing this review because I have not heard anything yet and can’t even get a rep on the line after so many call attempts and voice messages left. Every document requested have been sent back within 24 hours. Over 45 days. It’s been over 2 months. On day 33 I sent an email asking for an update and if there is a hold up since a refi should only take 30-45 to close. I was advised that “we are within the normal timeframe”. Ok 2 month later and still no answer is definitely not under a normal timeframe. They save your phone number so when you call, you can’t get anyone on the phone and you leave a voicemail to never get a call back. I never put any reviews up but the lack of professionalism is out of control.",1
Mark,"Lexington, KY","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2020","Quick and responsive. Made to feel appreciated. Answered all questions. Were not not overly pushy, demanding from beginning to end.

Josh,"Englishtown, NJ","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2020","The rate might be good, but their service is awful. No one has any knowledge of their products and services. I’ve closed almost two months ago and still haven’t received answers to my questions. They even charge $150 to set up bi weekly payments!!! Their lack of response and inability to answer customer questions is alarming at best. Their unprofessional comments to me questioning them was even more alarming. If I did that to a customer I would have been fired. I would rather pay a higher rate to know my questions and concerns are being address and know that I won’t be spoken to the way I was. Shop around!!",1
Fran,"Ocean Grove, NJ","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2020","I submitted a refinancing application with Amerisave as they were offering the most competitive rate and overall package apparently. After uploading all my documents and completing the disclosures, I received additional disclosures. One document in this package suggested a change in the fee listed on the loan estimate previously provided. I emailed and called my loan officer, Julio **, and never got a response. Only an email stating that he was caught up. I waited and sent follow-up emails and calls. On my last emails I also copied their customer service and generic loan office email. I never received a response or even an acknowledgement. I'm going to stick with the known banks.",1
Joseph,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2020","My wife and I did a refi to take some equity out of our home. The application process was fantastic. Ali walked us through everything. Kept us informed. We have nothing but praise for him. And then when he passed it on to the next person, the processor, however they do it, they were great. And then it went on to some girl for the final closing and she was fantastic too. She called me on a Friday night at 8 o'clock to let me know something. I told her, ""What are you doing at work? Go home.""",5
Michael,"Prospect Heights, IL","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2020","I was looking for a refinance with a better interest rate. I filled out a profile on LendingTree and I was matched with AmeriSave. Their portal to upload documents is very rudimentary. I've used other ones like Rocket Mortgage through Quicken Loans which was way easier to use. AmeriSave has to update their portal. Other than that, everything was good. My phone processor, Teresa and John were helpful and everything was good.",5
Eric,"Arlington, TX","Reviewed Sept. 22, 2020","I had a refinance originally and I looked into a mortgage to take advantage of the lower rate. Everybody's doing everything online now, especially with COVID, and it seemed like AmeriSave was very well prepared in the background. The website was really user-friendly, the communication, notifications,  and being able to access your documents and upload them. That was really a piece of cake. Also, I dealt with Alfredo mostly and he did a fantastic job. He answered most of my questions because it's always a complex process for us and he was very knowledgeable. He had answers for everything and if he didn't, he found them. We shaved off three-quarters and shortened the term to 20 years. We're still saving money when all is said and done with the consolidation. It was a great experience.",5

Lehman,"Kailua, HI","Reviewed Sept. 21, 2020","Our experience with AmeriSave went pretty well. I'm in Hawaii, so it was a little bit difficult with the time difference. That was the biggest hurdle that we had to jump through throughout the process. But other than that, Gage, the rep I worked with, was very attentive and answered all my questions. He was really quick to respond to anything that I needed. I was very happy with the terms I received. He did a great job getting me the best deal he could. There were some other issues. I had to go away for training and was not able to have my phone with me, so I had to do a power of attorney. There was a lot of back and forth with the escrow office, the title office and AmeriSave on getting the documentation right. But it wasn't too painful.",5
Ken,"Land O' Lakes, FL","Reviewed Sept. 21, 2020","AmeriSave Mortgage was number one on the list of top ten mortgage companies. But just as importantly, they had very low rates and very fast processing of the mortgage. It was also very convenient, and their website is very easy to follow. They put all the documents out there. The whole thing, including all the way up to closing, was not quite four weeks. They did a good job. The three people's names that were terrific were Clint, Alicia and Christina. The rates and terms were just like what they promised me, and the rate was very good.",5

There was one computer glitch one day, but that was fixed the next day, and AmeriSave's loan officer was professional and the guy that came and did all the paperwork with the title company was great as well. The rate and terms are comparable to other lenders. I didn't know if paying the points to get the better rate was just something I would have had to do with other people, but I was just more willing to get it done. I'm satisfied.",5
William,"Farmville, VA","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2020","I was supposed to close with another lender and thankfully came across AmeriSave and ended up saving thousands of dollars as we compared rates and fees.

Everything worked out fine with AmeriSave. I got the interest rate and the term I wanted and a little extra cash. They were very easy to deal with and they have a nice website, too. They let me buy down rate and they explained to me how much it would cost to buy down that and how long it would take to get that money back. They helped me make a very good deal. They're legit. Sometimes, you find these companies online and you don't know who they are. But I did a little research and the way everything turned out, they did exactly what they said they were gonna do.",5
Hyeon,"Irvine, CA","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2020","The online application was pretty seamless and I provided all my W-2s and tax. I have over 850 credit score and employment history, and I didn't know why it seemed like the underwriting took two months. But I understand this thing is not quick and they have to check the property and all that stuff. The rate was pretty good. I compared it with others and it seemed to be as close to the one of the top tier, the best rate. The originator was very aggressive to do the loan but the processor wasn't very communicative or sometimes he didn't quite explain it right or blamed it on the IT problem and it wasn't really that problem. They act like this is the first time they're doing it which I couldn't understand because they do this loan for business. Overall, it's pretty good, it's just that it took long.",4
Fernando,"Lawrence, MA","Reviewed Sept. 18, 2020","I'm an expert in computers and I found the application easy to do. I'm trying to lower my interest rate 'cause I was paying too high.

There were a couple of times where I had to ask the processor gal if she talks to the other guy because it wasn't what we talked about. I literally emailed, ""Do you guys talk to each other? Because we already discussed this piece."" So whatever was discussed and agreed upon should be in some sort of communication so that they have some way of talking to each other.

And for every rate offered, there is the amount of lender credit which was being offered, so it made it very easy to understand. AmeriSave had the best price.

Andrea,"Kahului, HI","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2020",Brian has been wonderful to work with on 3 refinances for our family. Great customer service and the best rates around! We never felt pressured and didn't receive sales calls after talking with them. Loved the online documents as well. The forms were easy work through on the website which made completing the process simple. Would highly recommend AmeriSave Mortgage.,5
Ronald,"West Carrollton, OH","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2020",They are amazingly friendly and helped me every step of the way. I had no issues at all during the process. Also they contacted me constantly with any updated information. They made the process simple and I was able to refinance with no issues whatsoever.,5
Huidong,"Princeton, NJ","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2020","We refinanced with AmeriSave. We used them for something else before. I contacted four banks and AmeriSave is the lowest. Also, the for the additional phase or process, it saved me a few thousand dollars. Their application process was very easy. It was strange though because AmeriSave has my employment information, all the data. So, I didn't need to input by myself and that saved a lot of time and made everything a lot faster. However, the appraisal took a little bit of time to complete. But they were proactive and very nice to work with. I liked the agent a lot. He helped me to ease the process and gave me good expectations.",5
Steve,"Mission Viejo, CA","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2020","There was clear communication and they were very speedy. They followed up with me on the refinance and they were on time. They have a secure site and I felt comfortable with the online application. Everything went smoothly. I was very satisfied. They have great rates and very low fees, so I was very happy with what we ended up with.",5
M.,"Fl, FL","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2020","I was piloting the deal with AmeriSave and the process was easy, painless and convenient, but it was also overly lengthy. It took a very long period of time before the funds were disbursed. However, as much as that was an inconvenience, Christopher was great. This representative kept his hand on the pulse and was very responsive throughout the whole waiting period before they processed the loan. I understand that with dropping interest rates, everybody and their mother is applying for a refinance, so they were boggled up with a lot of work. All in all, the length of time it took was the only frustration we had. AmeriSave had the best interest rate presented, and their representative had the best demeanor. The customer service was very prompt, even after hours.",5
Steven,"Lakeport, CA","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2020","Updated on 01/28/2021: My main review can be seen from 9/11/2020. This is a follow up on the progress. As I had stated previously, after many phone calls waiting for customer service for an average of 30 minutes each time to try to fix their information on my flood insurance they had incorrect, they assigned me a problem specialist named Angie to contact directly. She was great until I started getting the warnings all over again from AmeriSave that the flood insurance was not correct. I called Angie and was informed she no longer worked there. Calling them again and waiting for the runaround was a continued waste of my time. ",2
Chuck,"Londonderry, NH","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2020",Everything about my refinance went as outlined by my originator. Original estimate was bettered by actual outcome. Highly recommended. All of my contacts at Amerisave were professional and very helpful. Online document exchanges and in home closing made it a very convenient experience.,5
Sharon,"Fenton, MO","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2020","A refi is not the most fun task to undertake. It is even more stressful during a pandemic when it is done virtually. Both our Loan Originator, Tessa **, and our Processor, Benjamin ** responded quickly to our many questions. I felt they listened to our concerns and strived to meet our goals. We enjoyed working with them both. I'm finding out from my other friends going through their refi that ours went smoother and faster than theirs have. We are glad we did this and would recommend giving AmeriSave a look.",5
Suleiman,"Vallejo, CA","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2020",Shaun ** and the team at AmeriSave mortgage always pull through to make the process of refinance go smooth from the beginning to end. Everything is user friendly and easy to follow. This is my 3rd time using them and I definitely recommend them.,5
Christopher,"Placerville, CA","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2020",My only hesitation with AmeriSave was that they required a payment upfront of the application fee. It was $500 and they required that before they’ve even approved you. But everything went smoothly with great communication after that. They changed systems in the middle of my application but that was just a one-time thing. They switched their online website system so even their employees were learning it. It created a slight wrinkle but it was not a big deal. Everything went perfectly in the end. Their rates were very competitive and usually lower than anyone else. So I'd recommend them.,5
Elias,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2020","The process was straightforward and it went well. It’s fast, except whatever you will need to submit, they go through the portal and they'll keep on emailing you. They don’t normally give me an update though. Sometimes I have to try to call and follow up. I had conversations with the loan advisor and when she's not around, I spoke to a manager. Both of them were excellent. I was satisfied with the rate as well. I recommended one of my coworkers and he’s processing his application right now.",5

Michele,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2020","I called and spoke with the lady named Kyle. She's been very helpful. In fact, I'm doing two loans with her. But the process is a pain in the neck. I'm the old school and I like to do face-to-face in the office. But everything is electronic now and there is no paperwork except if I print everything, which gets very expensive. AmeriSave should offer the option of paperwork, where they sign to get it to them right there and then. When you go to look at the setup for the documents in their website, it's not really user-friendly. It's typical of what I learned when I was working in my younger years, somebody sitting in an office and coming up with great ideas how to improve the system. But then nobody checks with the customer if it's an improvement or not.",5
K.,"Ma, MA","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2020","The customer service did a good job. The people that I dealt with were very communicative. Once I had started a relationship with them, they were very forthcoming and very responsive. There was a long lag time when they dropped the ball between individuals and that caused some trouble, but other than that, it went fine. The process was longer than a month, but that didn't trouble me because interest rates were coming down the entire time. Had it been the other way around, I'm sure that we would have been talking to each other much more quickly.",3
Milton,"Rosamond, CA","Reviewed Sept. 9, 2020","I was in a 5/1 ARM. I had it on 0.23 to refinance before I started going to the variable APR, but I wanted to take advantage of the low interest rates. The online application was good. I was unaware that because of the pandemic, mortgage applications have gone up 80% according to the loan originator. So that kinda hindered the process a little bit and it was a little bit frustrating. Normally, a process took a month. But it took me almost three months. ",5
Charles,"Washington, DC","Reviewed Sept. 9, 2020","Everything's online these days and maybe AmeriSave can benefit from doing all the emails through one website where it was all in a central repository. Some of the materials I had to do through the website, but then I ended up emailing with two different people, the loan originator and the loan processor. Sometimes it felt a little confusing. It might be simpler if everybody was on one big email chain or everything was in a message center, but it eventually got done. There were lots of paperwork back and forth, but everything seemed to flow smoothly. It took a month in total, and now I have a new mortgage at a better rate.",5
Belinda,"Mission, TX","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2020","I took advantage of refinancing with AmeriSave because they offered me a low rate. Initiating the loan took about two hours. The process was super easy because they make a profile and you can go in and you see all the process going on. I really liked it because it was by the minute and I could see it online. At the end, I had to wait to get a hold of a title company. That was where it could be improve because i took so long to talk to someone personally once it was handled by the title company. But AmeriSave answered all my questions every time I had a concern. I either have the person I dealt with or his supervisor talk to me and make me feel at ease ‘cause this was all done online. They even gave me their direct number so if I ever had any questions, I could contact them.",5
Laurence,"San Diego, CA","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2020",I’m a repeat customer of AmeriSave. The process was simple. It was very fast-paced. The rep I worked with was excellent. I was impressed by his professionalism. I was very satisfied with the rates and terms of the mortgage.,5
Montez,"Nanjemoy, MD","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2020","I started this process 7/11/2020, provided everything they asked including the $500 for an appraisal. This has been ridiculous. I think my first originator was fired but at least he’d call back. The replacement is absolutely disgusting. No return call, I email response, nothing. I was told it would take two months to close. It’s been two months. Mr. Robert Smith, your leadership team is abominable. If they were great you wouldn’t have so many recent complaints of this caliber. I likely need a refund. Two months is this Thursday. I’m now looking for a more reputable and reliable me company.",1
Arthur,"Tallahassee, FL","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2020","I saw that interest rates were pretty low so I figured to do a mortgage. I went to LendingTree then a bunch of people including AmeriSave contacted me. As soon as I put my phone number in there, the phone started ringing and getting text messages for like two days. The initial application was probably an hour. Over the next couple of weeks, I submitted bank statements and documents. I called them to see if there was a way to make online payments for convenience sake and the reps were fine. I was happy with the outcome.",5
Stephen,"Tucson, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2020","The guy from AmeriSave that I was dealing with, gave me all the information that I needed. He disclosed all the fees upfront. He told me exactly what options I have. He was a very good guy. I was very comfortable with him. I called him every time I needed something. The refinance was pretty straightforward. I did get some automated updates all the time, and some of them were outdated. Sometimes, it would tell me that they need some information from me while I have already submitted it. Other than that, the terms were pretty great. I would tell others that AmeriSave is a great company, and they got good customer service and good rate.",5
Romer,"Bellingham, WA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2020","My experience was excellent. Very friendly staff and great interest rates! They helped me to save a lot of money in the long-term.

Anthony,"Chester, VA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2020","I searched for refinance and AmeriSave came up. I had conversations with them and they were very positive. I've tried to consolidate years before and other companies wouldn't accept. I got a mortgage under the Bush administration and housing was going up crazy and coming out with 80/20 mortgages. It was such a hot mess and I was a victim. They screwed me and I paid for it. Finally, AmeriSave came through and said they could do it. It was a wonderful thing. The rep was excellent. Any questions I had, she would get right back to me. I could text her. I haven't been through this process in a long time and she answered all the questions. She walked us through it. If I had an issue with, she was right there. I have nothing but praise for AmeriSave.",5

Michael,"Monterey, TN","Reviewed Sept. 5, 2020",It went great with AmeriSave. I went with them because of their rates and Omar who was the person that helped me through the loan process was great.

Paul,"Hoffman Estates, IL","Reviewed Sept. 4, 2020","I went to a mortgage site that allowed me to select a number of different possible mortgages. AmeriSave was one of the lower rates. I shopped in other places too but AmeriSave still seemed competitive. I proceeded with them and they seemed very easy to do business with them. For the most part, things went very well although they had a little trouble for some reason with my Comcast email. It would seem to go to spam. ",5

Would highly recommend to all our friends and family.",5
Christopher,"Sanger, TX","Reviewed Sept. 4, 2020","I did a Google search of top companies in my area and AmeriSave was one of the ones that popped up. I looked at them and four other companies. Two of the companies were knocked out relatively quickly because of their projected interest rate was 0.5 to 0.75 higher than AmeriSave. Then I was down to three. AmeriSave wanted $1,000 closing, then this other company wanted $2,200, and the rollover amount was higher. So there were more fees involved that knocked them out. Then I was down to AmeriSave and one other company. At the end, the only difference between the companies was about a 0.25 in the interest rate and about $2,000 in closing cost because of fees. So I decided to go with AmeriSave from there.",3
Jan,"Tucson, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 3, 2020","We were very appreciative of the ease in which we could refinance. George **, the Loan Originator, was easy to talk to and listened to me.

They ran a couple of different scenarios for me, determining a couple of different situations and one at a higher rate with lower closing costs. Then I picked the one that made the most sense to me. I went with a 15-year fixed program. The process was pretty straightforward. They came through with the best deal. Also, the fact that it was all handled online was nice for me. ",3

I called the first guy and he said that somebody should've contacted me but that person apparently didn't.

When I called helpline it would keep getting disconnected- almost as if they did not want to answer me. All I ask is to know the time line for the application and where I stand in the whole process but information is not forthcoming- it’s almost as if they have blocked me out now that they have the application money- once agent told me that the funding provider decides how long the process would take - but they haven’t even collected any documents from me!!!

I researched and found out that AmeriSave was one of the top recommendations. I tried to start doing the mortgage back in January, and found out I was not on the title. So, I had to go through probate and had my name put on the title. I had to call and had them stop the process. As soon as I got put on the title, they were more than happy to pick it back up. We got it taken care of. When I called the guy that I talked to when I first talked to AmeriSave, he said, ""I saw your name come up, and I smiled."" So that kind of made me feel good. As far as the terms, I did awesome. I knocked three years off, and I got some money back. I would recommend AmeriSave to anybody.",5

Tj,"Durham, NC","Reviewed Aug. 21, 2020","I began a mortgage refinance in April 2020. It closed in August 2020. I live in a house that I can easily afford each month accounting for only about 20% of my monthly income. My liquid assets are also more than enough to cover any necessary expenses. The appraisal actually came back higher than was expected or necessary. I completed every document request the same day. I even asked during the process what was taking so long and if anything else was needed. I was confidently told there were no issues and my finances more than satisfied the requirements. It is entirely unacceptable to take four months to complete a mortgage refinance especially when the value of the home, my income, and my liquid assets aren't even remotely in question.",1
James,"Cary, NC","Reviewed Aug. 21, 2020","We were shopping for a mortgage and AmeriSave reached out to us. We got a 30-year fixed loan through them. We spent half an hour talking to their loan originator and she was fantastic. She took us through the app process and was able to do the approval right then on the phone. Unfortunately, things fell apart from there because we just uncovered some things with our previous loan that we didn't know about. There was a zero dollar lien against the house that we had a heck of a time trying to get removed. The loan processor wasn't very good with communication. Otherwise, going with AmeriSave would have been a slam dunk.",4

Most recently, I went with AmeriSave after starting with Lending Tree trying to get a lower interest rate. The process this time around was easier and time went much quicker. The process started with a phone conversation and then we went via email. I liked their website which had documents I could grab when I was available and I was able to do things on my time. The process took less than three weeks. I wish the rate was lower though. When I saw advertisements on Facebook and other programs, the ads say the rates are such and such. In reality, to get to that rate, I have to pay more points upfront. Still, everything was fine.",5

Lee,"Loveland, CO","Reviewed Aug. 17, 2020","I do feel this is a real company, and I am optimistic my loan will eventually close, but I applied for this refi 2 months ago and still have no closing date set. Over a month with no communication. Perhaps most concerning, I was initially quoted a great rate (the reason I went with AmeriSave), but after the appraisal, they increased my rate dramatically. When I called about it, my loan officer said my ratios had changed, but I informed her there was no change that should have justified the increase. We adjusted the principal of the loan down because the home appraised for less than expected, but if anything, my rate should have decreased because we were now taking on less debt. ",3

On the day that release of financial contingency was due I called Amerisave and asked if my loan was ""guaranteed"". In an email I was assured I had the loan and I should proceed with releasing the financial contingency. One day before the close of escrow I was informed I did not get the loan. Reason: I had a Covid forbearance on my credit score. They were unaware of the Fannie Mae stipulation that paying 3 consecutive mortgage payments would satisfy the forbearance issue. I provided proof that I had paid 3 consecutive payments and I had satisfied all other issues for my loan. They said they needed to research my discovery of the Fanny Mae regulation.

We live in a homeowner's association subdivision and they were having problems getting a document. So they were asking me to go get it. The whole thing was almost getting hung up. The lady claimed she made a phone call so I made one phone call and ended up getting whatever was needed. But I don't think the underwriters actually made the phone call nor the outbound email that they did. They should never ask the customer to have to go do something. That's what they're for. ",5

They were professional and the follow up was good but they fell short on the underwriting. People were just checking boxes and they weren't looking at my data, which caused some big issues for me. They didn't bother to look at my name correctly as well as my address. There was a bankruptcy that they said was me and it wasn't. To be candid, they looked at my first and middle name and that was the name of the person with a bankruptcy. It was in a different part of state and had a different Social Security but they almost declined my loan. We almost lost my business because of that. It was resolved but I had to go through it in the time of COVID. It was a complete nightmare because somebody was too lazy to look at the details of the information. So that was very lackluster.

There's a little fluctuation in the points but once it got locked in, we were happy with the outcome. No closing cost would have been nice but AmeriSave did a good job.

Mark,"Waverly Hall, GA","Reviewed Aug. 12, 2020","They have very friendly and very knowledgeable folks. It was a good experience.

I told them I would talk to other people and I went to another vendor and they gave me a quote. I told them that I was already getting that from another vendor and then they got me a lower rate. So it was back and forth between three different vendors until AmeriSave said the best they could do. I went with it but if they're willing to give it to me a week later, why didn't they give me that the first time? But they're not the only company who does it.

I told her that. I was really overwhelmed and I yelled at her but after that, it never was the same again. I ended up dealing with her manager after that for the rest of the process. His name was Eric and he was also great. It was a lot of work for her and I'm somebody who likes to know every little detail about every little thing so that I can explain it to my husband.

You have to scan some documents. I did everything online and through phone. I just had to take a picture of the documents and send them to the website. The agents were straightforward, because in case I would ask for some necessary details like details of the loan itself, I can go straight to the loan originator. They can get basic information, but not the more detailed ones. And then, the delay was due to the pandemic and because everybody is doing refinancing. But other than that, the process was smooth.",5

The perception I got from him is that he was very overwhelmed with his workload. If I called to ask him a question he would tell me that he had just 2 minutes to talk or he’d ask to call me back, which wouldn’t happen. I was having to help him acquire forms, for example, from my Insurance company (essentially do his job) because he was “too busy”, Just to try to complete everything so that I could get the loan to close.

He was not able to give me a 2.5, but he said he was gonna work with me on the fee. The 2.5 was gonna cost me about $4,000, whereas going with AmeriSave would cost me much less than that. I was gonna have a final balance of 297 from the other companies, and through AmeriSave, I ended up with a 291 and a lower interest rate.",5
Leanne,"North Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed Aug. 2, 2020","I went on LendingTree, and AmeriSave happened to have the best rates. Their process was pretty easy. The lady that helped me was really good.

Randall,"Menifee, CA","Reviewed Aug. 1, 2020","I talked to my financial advisor about what I should do to take care of the issue that I had concerning getting this money and without prompting that to the sales originator to talk to me, I told him what I wanted to do and he told me exactly the same thing what my financial advisors said. I had pretty high confidence that he was trying to sell me a loan that fit what I needed and not something that was just in the interest of AmeriSave. I thought that was pretty cool. ",5
Sarah,"San Rafael, CA","Reviewed July 31, 2020","The rates were incredible, and service was prompt, efficient, and thorough.

Bryan,"Miami, FL","Reviewed July 31, 2020","Requested a quote for a mortgage refinance. Got a call from one of their agents, Joe, early the next morning. He basically read off similar numbers that I was presented online and moved directly into a very combative, hard sales act. He was so focused on closing the deal, I had a list of additional questions which he didn't even let me get through. Instead he hung up on me because I was ""wasting his time"". Excellent customer service guys.",1
Lucien,"Louisville, KY","Reviewed July 31, 2020",I needed to refinance my Condo. I looked at all the lenders available and AmeriSave was the first company that called me back.

Trevor,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed July 31, 2020","I tried some places locally including my bank I had previously and they were unwilling to do anything remotely close to resembling what I was seeing in the market. One of the other vendors that contacted us was incredibly pushy, very rude, and difficult to talk to on the phone. The people at AmeriSave were the complete opposite of that. They were easy to talk to. They would take time to answer questions. They answered the phone. They weren't rushing to push me through anything. They wanted me to be comfortable, look at stuff, and make sure I was understanding about what's going on. It was a nice process. Their rates have been lower through one of the refi.",5
Eric,"Brookhaven, GA","Reviewed July 31, 2020",I got a 30-year fixed loan program and everything went good. They gave me the best deal. They went out of their way to get my business and did everything they said they would.,5
Tam,"Van Nuys, CA","Reviewed July 30, 2020","I applied online on Amerisave.com to get a pre-approval letter. I got informed that AmeriSave only does soft inquiry on my credit report in order to get me pre-approved. I also double check with a Loan Originator (William **) before I hit submit button to confirm that would be a soft pull. I didn't provide any SSN number, but turns out AmeriSave did a hard inquiry on my credit report instead of soft inquiry. I called Equifax Mortgage Services which AmeriSave requests to pull my credit, and they told me AmeriSave requests them to hard pull my credit from all 3 bureaus on both mine and my wife credit report. I tried to contact William ** to resolve my issue and he could not do anything and told me to contact customer service. I called customer service and they transferred me back to William **. AmeriSave, this is a fraud. Please fix this issue.",1
Timothy,"Temecula, CA","Reviewed July 30, 2020","The place I normally use was shut down for getting in trouble a couple years ago. We had done a loan once before and had used AmeriSave. Only problem is apparently, this experience wasn't bad enough that I remembered it was a bad experience, because I ran inquiry a week after I started the process with them. I got a notice in the mail about a class action suit against AmeriSave.",1
Michael,"Royse City, TX","Reviewed July 30, 2020","We were refinancing a mortgage. We went with AmeriSave and everything was very good. It worked out all right. I took a little of the equity out to pay off some bills that we needed to get rid of and the payment didn't go up and the interest rate went down, so I was good with it. The hardest thing was I wasn't home and I happened to do stuff from out on the road with them. And where I'm at, the internet's really bad. So, it was either I had to go someplace to do it or wait in the weeks. But it took about six weeks altogether from start to finish. We closed in late July, and we started sometime in June. The timeframe wasn't bad. My consultant was Steve. He did a great job. He answered all of our questions and I had no problems at all. He was there pretty readily available when I needed him to answer something or to check something.",5
John,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed July 29, 2020",I was treated with respect and fairly throughout the refinancing process. It was a great experience.

Sandra,"Sevierville, TN","Reviewed July 29, 2020",The rep from AmeriSave was great and communicated well. We were surprised that the lady came out to the house on a Sunday to do the closing. We’re so used to going into an office.,5
Russel,"Columbus, OH","Reviewed July 29, 2020","I was looking at something on Facebook and saw that AmeriSave’s rates were good. I wound up speaking to a few people. I didn't know if it was quite what I wanted but after speaking with the rep from AmeriSave, I decided that it was what I wanted to do. He was very informative and helped me. We went with a 15-year program and so, we knocked years off our mortgage. We made a couple of changes and bought some points. We paid $4,000 to save $14,000 in monthly payments alone, so it saved us quite a bit of money. The process of getting the mortgage was great and I was happy with all aspects. The initial rep was fantastic. I also refinanced a rental property at the same time so that was a little bit of double processing but that was why I did it. The online application was excellent and I didn't have any problems with it at all. It was easy to do. ",5
J.,"Oh, OH","Reviewed July 28, 2020",I was searching for a loan to get to the VA. Nicholas and Boyd took the time to answer questions when we called them and worked with us to get the loan through.

Everything went the way it was supposed to with the loan.,5
Marsha,"Aiken, SC","Reviewed July 27, 2020","We heard about AmeriSave through a friend who refinanced. The rep was fantastic and he always got right back with me. He was honest and stayed on top of it but he wasn't pushy. The underwriting process was easy to understand. He told me what I needed ahead of time so, I went ahead and got it together, so it didn't seem like a lot when it came time to need it.",5
J.,"Ak, AK","Reviewed July 27, 2020","I saw what the markets were doing, so I wanted to refinance. I googled a bunch of different companies and went with AmeriSave. The online application process worked out great. It was really easy to use. They were pretty quick, but it's hard to contact them. I think they're pretty busy, so they're hard to get a hold of. I'm mostly playing phone tag. Also, AmeriSave's history bugs me. They did some shady stuff back in the day. After I had already started the process, I found a whole bunch of stuff where they're screwing people over back in like 2012.",3
Tammy,"Marietta, GA","Reviewed July 26, 2020",I was appreciative of the very quick response by AmeriSave to my request for refinance. Amerisave's website made it easy to send in information and directly connect with my bank. The Amerisave staff took the time to explain everything in detail and always quickly responded to any questions I had. They made the refinance of my home very quick and easy and I was given a much better interest rate than other banks could offer.,5
Shalene,"Chatham, LA","Reviewed July 26, 2020","I was researching some mortgage companies online and Amerisave had a good rating so I applied. It was a refinance of another property that we had and I was a little disappointed in how long it took. It was because it was a refinance on top of a property that had been my father's property and it had been in a reverse mortgage. The reverse mortgage kinda delayed things a little bit because it had gone into foreclosure, which had nothing to do with me, but it came up during the process. It did take longer than I thought it would take and it was a little more complicated than what I expected. ",5
Andy,"Winterville, NC","Reviewed July 26, 2020","I was looking for someone with the best possible interest rate and I did a Google search. I found AmeriSave and the rep, Chris, was awesome. I had another option with the same variables involved but I liked him. He stayed on the phone with me at 11 o'clock at night trying to walk me through the website application. Any time I called, answered or if he didn't, I would leave a message or text him. He would call me back within the hour. He was patient too. Overall, it was a good process. ",5
Ali,"Philadelphia, PA","Reviewed July 25, 2020","How the loan gets closed and transferred with new loan number is very poorly communicated. You are left high and dry right after the loan is closed.

Gwendelle,"Indianapolis, IN","Reviewed July 25, 2020","I was refinancing and AmeriSave’s rates and terms were good. I was pleased with that. The application and underwriting process was easy but it could’ve been easier. It was very frustrating that it took four months. The virus probably had something to do with it but it seemed like I had to repeat myself several times to some of the people who were involved. I kept having to go back to the guy who did the first application and then you had the underwriter. She’s the person who would call and ask questions about getting extra documents and getting payoffs. I'm not exactly sure where the disconnect was between us but it just seemed like I kept telling her the same stuff over and over, which delayed me.",4
Chinmaya,"South Lyon, MI","Reviewed July 25, 2020","The rates are low that's why I started my refinancing process. Then I was just shopping around and I came across AmeriSave, and then whatever I discussed with Jeremiah, who is the loan officer for me, sounded good. He described to me. He told me that they can do the price match with any other providers so that made me interested. However, I didn't like it when I got the processing fee. AmeriSave charged me $500 for that while other companies withheld it.",5

I went with an IRRRL, and the overall experience is a pain. It wasn't necessarily on AmeriSave. It was just the whole processes that AmeriSave was required to go through with the cash-out and the appraiser, and there are some difficulties with the appraiser at that time and a bunch of confusion as far as to kinda whose court the ball was really in.",4
Francis,"Mokena, IL","Reviewed July 24, 2020","AmeriSave’s rep was the first one to call back and I’m very satisfied with the rates and terms of the mortgage. The process took about a month but that was excellent. I thought it was gonna be a little bit longer. The gentlemen I dealt with answered all my questions so I was happy with that. I'm not used to a lot of electronic stuff and that got worrisome but Gray, the loan originator did a very nice job holding my hand and walking me through it. I was impressed with his patience.",5

Tim,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL","Reviewed July 23, 2020","The rep from AmeriSave was good and he was there when we needed him. But the company could improve on the time factor. It seemed it took forever for the person in this part of the country to talk to the person in that part of the country. There was very poor communication. The underwriting and the seller that originated it weren’t very good at all. Also, I had a home equity loan and they should've given me an option whether I wanted to keep it or not. They didn't and they closed it out. I didn't appreciate that because I can't get another one now. That was a safety net. They were supposed to notify me and they did not.",2

Vincent,"Nashville, TN","Reviewed July 22, 2020","I was looking for a lower rate or payment during refinancing. One of my colleagues went with AmeriSave and he had a good experience. I got everything I needed. Frank, the field guy, was very responsive. I had two underwriters. The first underwriter seemed to be good at first. But I called every week and didn't get any information and updates in rates. He was leaving a voicemail and so that one was a bit stressful. He should have the ability to push the loan. Then fell off because he was no longer with the company. It caused a little stress. But at the end of the day, I got ahold of Frank's boss and he was able to assign a new underwriter. At that point, everything was closed up in a week. ",4

There was only one case that they found bad, in which could have happened to anybody. The whole experience was really good. It seemed that they rushed it ‘cause from the beginning to the end, it was really quick and I'm satisfied right now. Everything went well.",5
Harris,"Tucson, AZ","Reviewed July 21, 2020","I was with another provider before I went to AmeriSave and they dropped the ball and then I just went on to a different company. The big problem with AmeriSave was there were lots of delays and lots of repeat of the same items. It was I might have sent the same document four times to two or three different people. There was no communication between parties and AmeriSave, and everything was messed up because of delay after delay after delay. I was supposed to close on a certain date and it didn't happen. It took an extra month for me to close my house. Somebody said, “We didn't get notified.” It was a lack of cohesiveness between all the parties involved in the transaction. It was not the greatest thing, but finally, it went through. Other than that, it was fine. The application process was okay too.",4
Mary And Frank,"Lincoln, NE","Reviewed July 20, 2020","Sean **, loan officer, provided outstanding service. He was able to navigate us through an easy loan application and closure. He was friendly, knowledgeable, patient and understanding. We had been working with Quicken Loans who were requesting multiple form submission and a pushy loan officer who was more interested in the closure. Sean presented multiple loans that were available, suggested paying our tax escrow in advance which made receiving money at the time of closing possible for us, handled our stress throughout the loan process and connected us with Kristen **, processing lead, who was also amazing in making this the easiest loan we have closed in our 40+ years of marriage (7 mortgages). Sean ** receives our highest possible recommendation.",5

If I didn't pick up 'cause I was in a meeting or something, he emailed me with any information or questions I had. He was dead on the money. There was another girl that was gathering the information and when she needed something, she would call me. On the day of the closing, the notary came over, filled out all the paperwork, and signed all the documents. Everything went as smooth as it could be.",5
Peter,"Swampscott, MA","Reviewed July 20, 2020","We looked into a mortgage for the lower rates and AmeriSave seemed to first appear to have that. We did a 30-year fixed program with them. However, it was almost like a bait-and-switch where they kept increasing the loan fee amounts. I was told at the beginning the rate wasn't locked in. But what seemed to appear to be happening was while the national rates were going down, they just kept trying to up the loan fee or the points on the loan so it cost me more than I expected originally. The application and underwriting process was good, however, it took two months which was a long time.",2

But the fees were a lot lower. I had a great experience working with AmeriSave.",5
Harold,"Monument, CO","Reviewed July 18, 2020","I have refinanced with some other people before but AmeriSave happened to be one that caught our eye.

Throughout the whole process, it went pretty smoothly that was why I ended up going with AmeriSave ‘cause everything was pretty easy. The application and underwriting took about a month and a half.

I was looking online and AmeriSave was the most convenient for me because of the very competitive interest rate. The application process for me was wonderful. The person that did my mortgage always answered the questions, was very professional, provided me with the complete information I was looking for and was very effective. He knew everything about mortgages, and can answer my questions about regular mortgages, APR and the points, and all of the questions regarding the closing disclosure and how to come out with the different numbers and all those kinds of questions regarding mortgage itself. We did it very fast. By law, we had to wait certain days after the underwriter. And then after the title, I had to wait three days, and then three more days after the title was signed.

Bryan,"Fithburg, MA","Reviewed July 13, 2020","From beginning to end, all of the staff I worked with at AmeriSave were great; in particular Jason ** (our loan originator) and Lul ** (the Processor who managed our loan).

Lev,"Livingston, NJ","Reviewed July 13, 2020","Have refinanced with Amerisave for a second time and could not be happier with their excellent service.

We also could always recommend our loan officer Nick ** to anyone in need of getting a mortgage to buy the house or refinance their existing one.",5
Ryan,"Berea, KY","Reviewed July 13, 2020",We had a great experience with Amerisave! They were able to get our refinance completed extremely fast and overall we had a great experience! We also saved thousands on closing cost. I would definitely recommend them for your next loan or refinance.,5
John,"Louisville, KY","Reviewed July 13, 2020","Amazed at the speed that this was completed in. Out rate was better than the other 2 companies we looked at. Excellent email, internet and phone call communication. We have used Amerisave before and this time was just as effective.",5
Colin,"Kansas City, MO","Reviewed July 13, 2020",Rob was great to work with! Overall very happy with my experience and have recommended two other people to Rob as well. My rate and monthly payment was easily able to be brought down. Overall I would certainly recommend AmeriSave and especially Rob's help.,5
Wil,"Bellville, OH","Reviewed July 13, 2020",End result was great. The virus caused some delay as the communication shifted from office to home based. We cut two years off the length of mortgage and saved several hundred dollars each month. The closing was very convenient for us.,5
Jonathan,"Salt Lake City, UT","Reviewed July 13, 2020","AmeriSave has a lower interest rate. Their online application process was very user-friendly too. Everybody that I worked with was very polite and they knew what they were talking about. They made it very smooth and it all went nicely. The rates and terms could have been better, but I’m satisfied with them.",5
Jose,"San Jose, CA","Reviewed July 12, 2020","Great experience. Tony got me the best interest rate in the market and made sure I was satisfied with everything. At first, I was hesitant using an online mortgage lender, but Tony’s knowledge and dedication helped me change my mind. I will recommend Tony to family and friends.",5
Sanad,"Marina, CA","Reviewed July 12, 2020","Your refinance needs are better understood and fulfilled when you reach out to Chanel **.

Nitin,"Monmouth Junction, NJ","Reviewed July 12, 2020","Extremely pleased with service of loan originator Mr. Ken ** of AmeriSave Mortgage.

Jeffrey,"Mckinney, TX","Reviewed July 12, 2020","Matt ** and the Amerisave team did a great job getting the loan I wanted at the most competitive cost, and completed the process quickly. My second time working with Amerisave, and I highly recommend them for a Mortgage. They are very customer focused.",5
Steve,"Red House, WV","Reviewed July 12, 2020","From start to finish Brad did a great job. Any questions I had at anytime he took care of it. At the end, he was able to push the attorney to speed up and get everything taken care of. It was excellent. I would fully recommend Brad **!",5
Valentine,"Brandywine, MD","Reviewed July 12, 2020","My experience with Amerisave was so great, starting with Vlad and Kim, the processor. I was guided well throughout the process. All questions were answered in a reasonable time and the process was flawless. I am glad that I used Amerisave.",5
Lance,"Ringgold, GA","Reviewed July 12, 2020",Top notch service all the way through. The team was great and constantly communicated and helped me through the process. I was concerned at first since there was no face to face meetings but Trevor was able to ease all of those concerns. I would recommend Trevor and his team to anyone considering refinancing their home.,5
Latonya,"Anaheim, CA","Reviewed July 12, 2020","Curtis ** & Allison** were very helpful during my loan experience. I was frustrated many times, but they both responded in a timely fashion & made me feel at ease. I would definitely recommend AmeriSave to any family or friends.",5
Karen,"Highland Village, TX","Reviewed July 12, 2020","Ross ** was wonderful. However we would get emails from others on things that had already been been completed or that we’re not required for a VA. Perhaps at the beginning of the refinance process, the customer could get a list of things required to complete instead of getting a dozen emails requesting “just one more thing.”",4
Eileen,"Hendersonville, TN","Reviewed July 12, 2020","My husband and I were researching companies to lower our mortgage and had submitted our information to an on-line site that obtains multiple company offers. We received 4 offers. I checked the BBB, on-line reviews, etc. for each. Only Amerisave had a AAA rating with the BBB and had excellent reviews on various sites. Roger ** was our first contact and he was fantastic. Highly knowledgeable, personable, low-key, excellent at explaining financial nuances and patient with me. I brought questions from other lenders to compare, and he was able to explain the pros and cons without being condescending about the other lender. He was the primary reason we went with Amerisave. Another company gave us the same rate with a tiny bit better cash benefit up front, but I went with Amerisave because Roger was so good. ",5
Brian,"Clayton, OH","Reviewed July 12, 2020",Mostly the experience was good. We had issues with some of the people working with the loan originator. We were also expecting all information that they needed to be sent to us right away so we could get it sent right away back to them. It was sent to us little bit by little bit making the process longer and more stressful.,2
Edward,"Gainesville, VA","Reviewed July 12, 2020",Exceptional customer satisfaction is guaranteed. Amerisave will offer you the lowest rate or will match it if you could get lower rate from their competitors. The team is full of high level professionals. I recommend Amerisave to everyone seeking for loan.,5
Jen,"Oreland, PA","Reviewed July 12, 2020",Very easy and smooth process from start to finish! User friendly online platform made the process very easy and I had access to status updates whenever I wanted. The staff were very knowledgeable and helped us reach our refinance goals.,5
Melissa,"San Bernardino, CA","Reviewed July 12, 2020","We went online and we applied. AmeriSave was the first one that called us back. The gentleman, Frank, was attentive. It seemed like it took a while to close the loan. I thought we’d do it in 30 days, and it took close to 45. I think it's because of the COVID situation and people working from home but the process was easy and we were happy. Once their underwriter got involved, everything seemed to move pretty fast. The processor might have been the underwriter. The gentleman was very professional and it all worked seamlessly. There was just a little bit of delay in the middle delay. Other than that, I thought they did a really good job given the circumstances of where we were at the time. Overall, we are pleased with everything.",5
Brandon,"Stillwater, OK","Reviewed July 11, 2020",Had a great experience with Amerisave. Ali was great to work with and he found us the best deal and was there through the whole process. Great rates and was able to do everything from home. Would recommend to anyone.,5
Jennifer,"North Myrtle Beach, SC","Reviewed July 11, 2020",The ease of refinancing through Amerisave can't be matched. They moved quickly and had all avenues of my refinance accounted for (attorneys/appraisal). The process for uploading and providing information was easy and convenience. Mario ** was an excellent customer service rep through the process. The process was smooth and easy.,5
Randall,"Tucson, AZ","Reviewed July 11, 2020",We got the best rate out of all the banks we looked at. The online process was easier and faster than anything I have used in past mortgages. They were there to answer all our questions when needed. Great experience.,5
John,"Rio Rancho, NM","Reviewed July 11, 2020","I got offers from many companies and I was going to go with Rocket Mortgage but they were dragging their feet and piece-mealing request for information. After a month and a half, I said, “That's enough.” I did research and made a phone call to AmeriSave. I talked to their rep and I was impressed with his knowledge. He said to give him the information I got from Rocket Mortgage and he would see what he can do. He beat the guy from Rocket hands down and so I went with AmeriSave. The process was a lot easier than Rocket Mortgage providing the documents that we request and only towards the end, they wanted me to resubmit one document three or four times, which I didn’t appreciate having to do that, but I get closer to closing and because it's a VA loan, they have to make sure everything was perfect. But providing the information went really well. I have nothing negative to say about how the loan was processed and the professionalism with which it was handled.",5
Michael,"Williamsburg, VA","Reviewed July 10, 2020",The refinance process with AmeriSave was very user friendly. The rates and options for the length of the loan were extremely good. Much better than many other mortgage companies. The representatives I worked with were excellent. I would highly recommend AmeriSave.,5
Jason,"Wenatchee, WA","Reviewed July 10, 2020","Always reachable, very informative, seamless and easy process, got me down to a 2.75 interest rate, gave me everything I asked for, recommended some better options, I would definitely recommend for a refi or for your new mortgage. Thank you Amerisave. Very much appreciated.",5
Kerry,"Hesperia, CA","Reviewed July 10, 2020",It was very professional and thorough with the process. Simple and fast. Always there to answer my questions. It was a pleasure to work with this mortgage company. I applied with other ones but chose this one for the convenience and straight forward process.,5
Tanja,"Lake Worth, FL","Reviewed July 10, 2020","I was seeing different companies and AmeriSave gave me the best rate. I got a 20-year refinance. The application and underwriting process took about a month and it was pretty straightforward and easy. Initially, my husband cosigned because they weren't able to use my rental income. There was an issue with underwriting. I could have had my husband cosign a lot earlier and it would have reduced the time that it took to close if we had known that upfront. But the customer service was great and professional. I worked with the loan originator and he answered all my questions pretty expeditiously. Overall, they're awesome. I would tell others to give them a try.",5
Len,"Saint Matthews, SC","Reviewed July 9, 2020","AmeriSave was easy to communicate with, they thoroughly explained everything that would happen, and each transaction was timely and correct. Documentation requirements were minimal and completing the entire process was a breeze. The closing attorney came to our house, wore a mask and maintained social distancing during this pandemic.",5
Gregory,"Medford Lakes, NJ","Reviewed July 9, 2020",From the start to finish it truly was an easy and seamless process to take advantage of the lower rates to refi. Highly recommend Amerisave for mortgage expertise. Everything was handled online and via phone in a very organized and easy to understand manner. Cannot say enough good things about our experience.,5
John,"Quincy, IL","Reviewed July 9, 2020",The overall process was a pleasant experience with professional assistance along the way. We never had much lag time when we needed assistance or answers to questions. The timelines given to us at the beginning were met and in some cases improved upon their initial suggestions.,5
Marylynn,"Anchorage, AK","Reviewed July 9, 2020","I received a prompt and personal response to every inquiry I made. The processor and the originator were personable and knowledgeable. Rate and fees were exceptional and the ease of application and approval was pretty impressive. Even in this crazy COVID time, with extremely low rates and very busy mortgage companies, we were able to go from application to closing within 30 days - a cashout refinance, and we didn't even need to get an appraisal. Berkley ** (processor) and Gjeto (Jay) ** (originator) should be commended for their professionalism and knowledge. Thank you AmeriSave.",5
Michelle,"Hopkins, MN","Reviewed July 9, 2020",All went great. The information given was accurate and the closing went very quickly. Julio was very informative and was always available to answer my questions. I would highly recommend Amerisave to a friend for the refinance or finance needs on a home.,5
Shani,"Ormond, FL","Reviewed July 9, 2020",Thank you Curtis ** for making my refinance experience a pleasant one. You and your support team were amazing. I will definitely keep you in mind for future transactions and I have already passed your name to a few of my friends.,5
Rebecca,"Arlington Heights, IL","Reviewed July 9, 2020","I was very pleased with the process at the beginning. It was easy to complete the application for refinancing, and I received a call shortly after completion. Robert was very responsive, and was a pleasure to work with. However, when it got close to closing, William was not very responsive, my closing got delayed because he did not have all of the closing documents in order. I was not happy with the lack of communication from William, and having to follow up regarding the status, and when my refi was going to close.",3
Mel,"Saint Johns, FL","Reviewed July 9, 2020","When we decide to refinance our home, we shopped around and compare rates & reviews. We narrowed our choices to two (2) companies and we decided to call AmeriSave. Though the whole process took like two months but we were happy with AmeriSave. We had a great, great experience with Ms. Allison ** and Ms. Emma **. They have been very helpful throughout the whole process. They were also available even on weekends when we have some questions. We highly recommend!",5
Michael,"Minden, NV","Reviewed July 9, 2020","Quintin was great and very helpful, the refi was easy, quick and a great value. I would do business again with AmeriSave again in a heartbeat. More business in this country should operate like them like AmeriSave. Thanks very much Quintin!!!!",5
Todd,"Winchester, VA","Reviewed July 9, 2020","I had a great experience with Amerisave! I shopped around for the best deal on our refinance and they were far better than all the rest. We were a little nervous go with a company that was no local, but our Loan Originator and Processor were awesome and always a call or email away! They kept things simple and it all wrapped up super fast!",5
Mujeeb,"West Sacramento, CA","Reviewed July 9, 2020",Good experience but response times were late. It took too long to get back to me. Not sure if it’s related for the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall I had a good experience. My loan officer answered my question immediately. Best to work with.,5
James,"Marietta, GA","Reviewed July 9, 2020","I wanted to refinance my home mortgage to a lower fixed interest rate. AmeriSave was able to accomplish this and more by providing great products and people who make the whole experience easy and wonderful. Kudos to AmeriSave and the wonderful, caring AmeriSave associates.",5
John,"Charlotte, NC","Reviewed July 9, 2020","The communication from Ryan and his team was excellent. They did a good job pushing the process along and were always friendly to talk to. The web application seems very outdated and clunky. For the size of their operation, I would expect a more robust web experience.",5
Robert,"Crownsville, MD","Reviewed July 9, 2020",My two Amerisave representatives were very good. They had extensive knowledge of the process and could efficiently execute the process. We did run into a problem with my title which seemed to delay a portion of the process. I still have an outstanding question as to whether my first mortgage payment is August 1st 2020 or Sept 1st 2020. I was told at settlement it was August then received updated documentation that indicated Sept 1. I am still awaiting clarification.,4
Anita,"Brawley, CA","Reviewed July 9, 2020","The terms I received from Amerisave placed me in a excellent position to payoff my mortgage in an exceptional period of time. Therefore, I am impressed with their expertise and professional consideration in delivering the best terms that were available in the mortgage market. Thank you.",5
Kim,"Hermitage, TN","Reviewed July 9, 2020","AmeriSave had the lowest fee charges than any other company out there. A lot of companies charge $500 for them to even do the application and AmeriSave doesn't do that. I did the VA 30-year fixed refinance with them. From the time I contacted the individual, he was very professional. The people answered all my questions in a timely manner and took care of everything so that was excellent as well. Throughout the whole process, everyone followed up and did all the paperwork in a timely manner. Everything was perfect from the electronic documents being uploaded to the things they asked me for. I got it back to them right away and they responded immediately. The best loan. I bought five houses and this is by far the best service I've received.",5
Sherri,"White Lake, MI","Reviewed July 8, 2020",We were extremely happy that we were dealt with extreme care - given the best deal with fast turnaround time! We would highly recommend them! Rami was especially great to work with - very attentive! Faster than expected closing! We were pleasantly surprised that our APR was lower than expected. Contact them ASAP if you want to refinance or do a new purchase!,5
K.,"Nh, NH","Reviewed July 8, 2020","I got a call from Amerisave and they offered a good price. It was decent. The loan person took care of a lot of details. I didn't have much time so he did a lot of work for me and explained to me all the pros and cons of taking different kinds of loans. This is my second refinance and I'm familiar with the terms so it also kind of made it easier for me to understand. Everything was straightforward. If they wanted some document, they would call me. If we had some issues, they would respond back quickly. I have other friends going through a similar process and Amerisave's is okay.",5
Michael,"Glendale, CA","Reviewed July 7, 2020",This was really a two part experience. The first part with loan originator Chris fix went extremely well from start to finish as he aggressively attacked problems and guided us along the way. The second part was less effective with our loan processor. We struggled to get complete information and there was a wait and see attitude toward delays and problems forcing me to be my own liaison to the title company. It came together at the end.,5
Edward,"Hammonton, NJ","Reviewed July 7, 2020","Refinance was quick and painless! Everyone I worked with was friendly, knowledgeable, and always available for a question. Further, the website was freaking awesome, not to take anything away from the people I worked with, but the website makes it easy to know where you stand, what the next steps are, and what you owe them. And did I mention it was quick? Highly recommended!",5
Deborah,"Selma, NC","Reviewed July 7, 2020","Ryan ** was very patient and informative. I trusted him the first minute that I was on the phone with him. He always answered my questions quickly and professionally. If he did not know an answer, he forwarded email to his co-workers who did know the answer.",5
Lori,"Newport, MI","Reviewed July 7, 2020",The customer service I received during my entire refinance was second to none. The AmeriSave website is very helpful and up to date. I always received an answer back in less than 24 hours of asking a question. Wendy ** and Adam ** are a huge asset to this company.,5
Manuel,"Miami, FL","Reviewed July 7, 2020",Marc ** and Michelle ** were both great in helping me get everything together and making it as easy as possible. Refinancing was simple as it can be and lowest fees I could find. I searched multiple refinance companies and they were definitely the most accommodating.,5
Benjamin,"Buffalo, MN","Reviewed July 7, 2020","We couldn't be happier with the great rate we got and the great service we received from the loan originator. After our appraisal was complete, we were moved to a loan processor who was very clumsy and slow. Several closing disclosures were wrong and we ended up pushing back the closing because of this one individual.",4
Roger,"Benton, KY","Reviewed July 7, 2020","My experience with AmeriSave Mortgage Corporation was great. If I had questions or concerns that needed answers, the staff was always very helpful to assist me anyway they could. I worked mostly with Joeseph ** and Jordan **. They assisted so much and were very helpful to any question or concern I may have had. Very satisfied customer!",5
Robert,"Arlington, VA","Reviewed July 7, 2020","Jonathan ** was excellent. He was straightforward and honest, no hidden fees or hiding savings by manipulating the amount going to escrow, as another lender tried to do. I was in contact with other lenders competing for my business and Jonathan was unmatched. He advised me when to lock in and saved me hundreds. The entire effort was quick and easy to understand. The Amerisave portal was an excellent place to post things and keep track of everything. Thanks very much!",5
Ramy,"Ocala, FL","Reviewed July 7, 2020","Amerisave Mortgage accomplished their mission of getting me refinance done within 90 days during an unfortunate global pandemic. I was discouraged in the begining, but they didn’t give up on me. I received great communication between my loan officer & processor. I even got a low interest rate with reasonable closing costs compared to the national banks. I would definitely recommend Amerisave Mortgage to all my friends & family.",5
Jheralyn,"Falls, PA","Reviewed July 7, 2020",5 stars! We had a great experience with Drew **! He went above and beyond for us. He kept us informed throughout the whole process of us purchasing a home. He was very knowledgeable and helpful. Would highly recommend AmeriSave and Drew!,5
Jessica,"Marysville, PA","Reviewed July 7, 2020","Amerisave had the best rate. Our rep was Dan and he was very helpful and timely. He was very professional with us and answered all my questions. We had a good experience with him. Doing the application online made me nervous a little, but I had time to review it and look it over. It looked okay, so we went forward with it. It was a little uncomfortable to do it that way, but it ended up being fine. The process didn't seem to take too long at all. There were a couple of times that they needed a document or a signature and there was a little bit of email back and forth for a couple of days. But all in all, it took a month or less so it was good. I've closed another house and it took a really long time. I'm very happy with Amerisave.",5
Francisco,"Moncks Corner, SC","Reviewed July 6, 2020","It only took two weeks from application to closing! Excellent service and the staff was very knowledgeable.

Gregory,"Houston, TX","Reviewed July 6, 2020",Great Job! I sincerely appreciate the assistance in this process. Your team went above and beyond and I am extremely grateful. I will definitely be recommending your team to family and friends in the future. Only thing I can recommend changing is the automated text messages. Those seemed to cause a bit of confusion.,5
Pam,"Humble, TX","Reviewed July 6, 2020","We were mostly pleased with the customer service by the agent. However, the appraisal company they hired did not do a very good job. The purpose of our refi was to get cash out for home improvement. But the appraisal was very very low - like 50K or more low. Our taxable value is currently 60k more than the appraisal. The properties they chose to use for comparables were odd. We had three real estate agents look at the appraisal and they were dumfounded. The only option was to pay for another appraisal to get a more realistic value to get the cash out we were looking for.",3
Paul,"West Chester, OH","Reviewed July 6, 2020",Excellent overall process. Online system for uploading/downloading and signing documents made it very easy. REFI Team was very informative and helpful throughout the process. With the heavy REFI volume due to historic low rates Mytch and the Team kept the ball rolling even when the process got bogged down in other departments.,5
Paul,"Chester, CA","Reviewed July 6, 2020",I was never left in the dark. He touched base with me every step of the way. He was honest and I never felt rushed or pushed. Gave me plenty of time to think about my options. I would recommend him to anybody even thinking about a refinance.,5
Greg,"Bartlett, TN","Reviewed July 6, 2020",I received professional and courteous service and would recommend to friends and family that they should consider Amerisave for their home refinance needs.

Scott,"Provo, UT","Reviewed July 6, 2020","Home refinance. It was nice knowing that you could look at our loan portal and see the updates on the loan. The loan closing was simple, it was arranged by the loan processor and closed on the date it was supposed to be.",5
David,"Redwood City, CA","Reviewed July 6, 2020",Everything went well with Amerisave. I went with them because of their low interest rate and the application process over the phone went well. Their customer service is very good. I had to wait for all the paperwork so the process took 30 days or even less.,5
Christopher,"Waldorf, MD","Reviewed July 5, 2020",A great team/great group and very personable and friendly. I will be recommending this team to anyone looking for services that they perform! Ms. ** and ** were the ones I primarily spoke with and they were exemplary!!!,5

Kate,"Ontario, CA","Reviewed July 5, 2020",Justin was helpful and explained all the steps of the refinance. I recommend his services. He communicated well and was available via email or phone. Amerisave offered great rates. Everything was completed in a timely manner. It was great to be able to deal with everything online. All the documents were easy to download and review. This is a bonus as we didn't have to leave our house to complete the process. This is important especially with the current Covid situation.,5
James,"Virginia Beach, VA","Reviewed July 5, 2020","Sean was the best. This was the easiest and most pleasant refi. I have heard horror stories about refis. Not so with Amerisave and Sean.

Michael & Deanna,"Parrish, FL","Reviewed July 5, 2020","We had a very pleasant experience with AmeriSave and were fortunate to have gotten Bradley ** as our representative.

Thomas & Debbie,"Carlsbad, CA","Reviewed July 5, 2020",Was extremely helpful when I couldn’t navigate through the computer to submit information needed. Walked me through step by step.

Robert,"Marion, AR","Reviewed July 5, 2020",We have used Amerisave for 2 refinances and have always found the experience to be pleasant and easy. Michael ** has helped us with both and has made both smooth and easy experiences. Amerisave's website navigation is easy and efficient.,5
James,"Merritt Island, FL","Reviewed July 5, 2020","I was given a very straight forward explanation of the loan process, the fees and all cost were reviewed and the POC (Greg) was upfront with how they did business. Once we came to an understanding he followed thru on every commitment and ensured the process was completed as required, and that I was personally emailed on any detailed that needed my attention. The closure we exactly as expected with no surprises or changes.",5
Donna,"San Rafael, CA","Reviewed July 4, 2020","We enjoyed working with Nabeel from beginning to end because he was always very professional, knowledgeable, and he educated us through the entire process.

Mark,"Sutton, MA","Reviewed July 4, 2020",Amerisave agents were professional and responsive through all aspects of the refinance process. Their online system of communication and documentation import was very useful during the process. They are very competitive with their rates. This is the second time I have financed with them and would recommend them to anyone.,5
Brian,"Richmond, VA","Reviewed July 4, 2020","I was looking for a fully digital experience and, aside from the inspection and closing, that is exactly what I got. The entire process was smooth, efficient, and timely, and the AmeriSave representatives were unfailingly attentive to making sure my needs were met by the refi.",5
Mark,"Kansas City, MO","Reviewed July 4, 2020",Gave me the best rate amongst any mortgage lenders. Very friendly and courteous employees.

Richard,"Prescott, AZ","Reviewed July 4, 2020",Ours went as smooth as it gets. Rate exactly as expected going in. One minor hiccup only outside their control. One star off only for the hiccup in the title process which slowed closing about three days. Both our officer and processor were timely and easily accessed for questions. Loved the online forms process to immediately upload necessary documents. That really helps the process immensely.,4
Pete,"Carmel, IN","Reviewed July 4, 2020",My experience with Amerisave was a good one. Up until now. I received a cancellation notice on my homeowner's policy. It appears that the title company you used did not pay my homeowner's insurance. I've reached out to them twice regarding next steps. They've not replied to me. At this point I just discovered my homeowner's insurances lapsed and I do not have coverage due to their feelings. And they are non-responsive. This is completely unacceptable.,1

Jacob,"Salem, WV","Reviewed July 3, 2020","Overall I was mildly satisfied with Amerisave. It took over 2 months to start and close my refinance. In that time my buy down increased over $2500. They said they would adjust that to close what we talked about. They took $600 off. Overall it was still a good deal and worth it. The only reason that I gave a mildly satisfied review is because my loan originator was awesome. Very helpful, kept me informed and did what he could to try to get my rate close to what we talked about. And 2 the online process was great. The way upload, view, sign, submit documents couldn't have been easier. I wouldn't overly recommend Amerisave, but I also wouldn't tell you not to use Amerisave. I would just caution that it won't be quick!",3

Helen,"South Lake Tahoe, CA","Reviewed June 29, 2020","I wish I had read prior reviews on this site prior to engaging with AmeriSave. I thought they were a reputable company. Jason is the loan officer I spoke with when I called the 800 number and he sounded very professional and helpful. However that's where it ended. As with other reviewers, after I paid the $500 application fee it's been totally silent. He would not return my calls and I followed up with emails and finally copied their customer service department. His manager Frank did call me last week and said it was with an underwriter. To date still no response. I've dealt with many mortgage companies and brokers and I must say this one is the worst. I think this company makes their money on the $500 upfront fee they make everyone pay. Stay away! With so many dissatisfied customers, there must be something Consumer Affairs can do or some other regulatory agency. I'd be curious to see what other reviewers have done.",1

She said everything should be ready to fund in about 20 days and complete in 30. Sounded good to me. I sent all requested info immediately and waited for a response. No response so I tried to call. Sarah finally called after I sent email and said her phone wasn't working. Right!

Mari,"Mesa, AZ","Reviewed June 6, 2020","Updated on 07/03/2020: Since my last post on 6/6/20, I’d hoped to receive a refund for my Application Fee from Amerisave. Since I have not, I will write another review, with a little more detailed information. On 4/10, I received a call from Hector **, after searching online refi quotes. He assured me Amerisave would get me a great rate and that the process would be fast and easy. So I paid for the App fee of $500 believing this mortgage company could refinance my home within a reasonable amount of time. For several weeks, he said the process was going fine. Then I eventually got no call back. When I emailed him, he would email the Processor to ask her the status, and never got back to me. The Processor, Amy ** told me she was either not at my file, away from her desk, in a meeting, or that my loan would close next week. This went on until I decided to cancel on 6/6/20, nine weeks after I initially spoke with Hector **. ",1
Josh,"Tracy, CA","Reviewed June 1, 2020","I wish I saw the reviews about Amerisave here before I started a refinancing process. As other consumers stated, they don't communicate with consumers well once you pay a $500 non-refundable fee. It was my big mistake to pay the fee upfront as I believed what they said, e.g., a great rate. You won't be able to lock your RATE and FEES until your loan is approved which will take several weeks. So you would end up with a very high interest rate and fee at the end. I emailed the loan officer several times to get an update but no response. My loan application would be just one of the many so they didn't care because I already paid a $500! I was extremely frustrated by their poor communication and unprofessional business standards. Now I know that I am not alone!!! Be careful!",1

We were supposed to be less than one week from closing when I was informed that my trust documents were not exact. Keep in mind my trust is certified through a legal expert and documented at the courthouse. Amerisave wanted to do a quick claim deed to process the loan and they had already contacted my insurance company to be listed as the lien holder on my property.

April,"Marshall, NC","Reviewed April 29, 2020",I started the process of refinancing my home with Amerisave in February. Due to the coronavirus things like inspections and appraisals went rather slow but I had immediately signed a rate lock at 3.8% when we started the process. Finally we were going to Close the last week of April the day before I was supposed to pay my current mortgage which they had told me not to pay because they had included it in the payoff amount. After not hearing from them I decided I better call and see how things were going. All of a sudden there was a problem with my loan. My rate had jumped up to 4.375% which was the same rate I already had with my current mortgage. I'm glad I decided to call so I can cancel the whole process and just pay my mortgage on time instead of listening to them and not paying it at all this month. ,1

Most mortgage companies I've dealt with do not take an upfront fee to start a loan process and never refund it. They assist you with finding a loan you can afford and qualify for. Even if you wanted to borrow $100K, if they see your income is not sufficient enough to afford it, work with the customer so every customer is qualified and happy. ",1

I was promised I wouldn't be charged an appraisal fee for this mortgage refinance if I gave my credit card information until I myself set an exact date, and gave permission for an appraisal. The lure is a rate offer the employee said he can get from his boss, and lock you into if you give your credit card information as a sign of sincerity.

During the last review AmeriSave decided they wanted an invoice to fix the walls of one of my 3 showers. Got them invoice in a day, then they decided they wanted it fixed or wanted the appraiser to change the appraisal. ",2
Sylvia,"Puyallup, WA","Reviewed July 9, 2019","I dealt with an agent named Robert ** who felt certain I would qualify for a refinance... Not taking any money out, just wanted lower rate. He immediately requested $500.00 to which I said, ""Ok. If you cannot get me refinanced I will get my money back, right!"" Robert said, ""yes,"" and we should have no problems; this was around May 2, 2019 and now in July they notified me that they could not do the refinance for me. I have been asking Robert for the refund for several weeks now with no response? AmeriSave, you need to train your agents to qualify people before taking the money, if I have $500.00 to throw around it would be for one of the many missionaries I know and support. Thank you for responding.",1

Tried explaining to the rep that they are calling a business, she promptly hung up on me. A few hours later, they are calling again from a different number so you can't block their calls altogether. Horrible way to do business, I would never do business with a company who uses telemarketer and scam tactics to get you on the phone, and refuses to take you off their call list.",1

Most closing are a game of dominoes - sell in the morning and buy in the afternoon. And this process dominoes for many transactions. People selling and people buying all hinging on one closing fouling it up for everyone. How discourteous not to give people a reasonable heads up that they aren't going to finish the process.

I had been working with a loan specialist to refinance our existing home and consolidate our debt into one payment. Joshua ** seemed well informed. He ordered an appraisal at a cost of 650.00. Our house appraised at 50,000 more than what our mortgage loan was to be. It was a ""sure"" thing that this was going to happen.

Wilhelmina,"Laurel, MD","Reviewed May 9, 2019","What I appreciate about AmeriSave and what sets it apart from all the other lenders was the cost of refinancing as by far, it was the only lender that was able to accommodate my 1st and 2nd mortgages when all the other lenders have told me I didn't have enough equity in my home to cover both. I believe it's because the other lenders have their fees too high.

That will tell you immediately they are not a legitimate business. You have no idea where they really are and that means they have the advantage over you. They are not to be trusted.

Timothy,"Bridgeport, CT","Reviewed Sept. 24, 2018","I wanted to do a refi and take some money out and AmeriSave Mortgage was the first company that was accommodating to my needs. The whole application and underwriting process took three weeks and it was really easy. AmeriSave did everything for me. I provided them the information and documents and uploading those was simple and very easy. Also, everybody that I worked with was easy to work with. I started the process with somebody else and we stopped and then I switched. Then, considering that the rates are going up right now, the rates that I got are reasonable. AmeriSave also subordinated my home equity loan, which was something I couldn't get someone else to do. Working with AmeriSave has enabled me to take out money and consolidate some debts. I have more free money to do projects around the house now. We would have no problem using AmeriSave again.",5

The application process was a little rigorous and it took about a month with the underwriting. The AmeriSave reps were on top of things and would call me. They also let me know if I needed something to make sure the process didn’t get delayed and were able to address our questions and concerns. However, there were a bunch of things that they needed on their end like they wanted an address for an oil well. But oil wells don’t have addresses. That wasn’t sufficient because they had to get that in writing. We also had a little snafu at the end that almost delayed the entire process and delayed the person I bought the house from. It only ended up being delayed for two hours, but it was a fairly big oversight and caused me an enormous amount of stress. The snafu was due to people that I did not talk to and it was on another end. But the people that I talked to from AmeriSave were great.",3

Everything was online and I could upload the documents and always have a status update during the day or at least the next step where my application stood. AmeriSave's reps were very helpful, and Aaron, the processing team lead, did a fantastic job. John, the senior loan originator, was great as well. I talked to him either through phone or chat. He was very responsive to different scenarios and programs. There was a basic amount of questions and then I was handed off to their application processing folks. That gentleman was very top of things and he gave me some options when things were not right on the website. So, the team worked great. ",5
A.,"La, LA","Reviewed Sept. 22, 2018","We needed to fund a home purchase and we got a 30-year conventional loan with AmeriSave Mortgage. At the time, they appeared to be a decent company. You gotta be financially able to have a mortgage, have funds, have a decent credit score, and provide all the documentation necessary in order to back those findings. The whole application and underwriting process took about 20-some odd days. The online application was expedited, but it could use a lot of work as far as being notified when something is due or when something is not due. The only communication is online instead of with a person and I think that hurts the business of AmeriSave. The initial person that we spoke to when we were getting started was very professional and very helpful. She handled her business and took care of everything.",1

And then I used them again because they made the experience a lot easier. They were a lot more respectful of the fact that I have a credit rating of over 800. My credit rating is 826 last time I looked. That didn’t seem to matter to a lot of mortgage companies that I’ve used. They didn’t believe anything I said. They made me prove everything and made me write long letters. On the other hand, Amerisave looked at my overall record and not the money I’ve got in the bank, and they made everything way easier all three times.",5
Fred,"Austin, TX","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2018","I previously worked with AmeriSave and I was happy with the services. So when I needed to buy a house, I chose to use them again. They sent me the steps. The house had to get appraised, we had to get the financing lined up, I had to get my bank statements and had to show proof income. I like the fact that the loan is not negotiable. I also like the fact AmeriSave is a one-stop shop with the best rate and we don’t have to go through a car sales routine to try to get the best price without them gouging me. We did the whole application and underwriting process in less than a month. It was very fast. There were a few things that were already in place that we had, which made things move faster. We were able to move the date up pretty quick and it went really well. ",5
Dianne,"Roswell, GA","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2018","I wanted to take some cash out to do some home improvement and consolidate credit card debt. I was considering refinancing then I went online, looked at a couple of things, and talked to four different companies. When the woman from Amerisave called me, I wasn't going to accept another quote, but she was very nice and very responsive. We talked for about 30 minutes and she went through some things. She talked to me about no closing cost, which I liked, and I ended up getting a new mortgage from them. It was truly the ability to close quickly with a very clear understanding of closing cost and what was and wasn't included that made me go with them.",5
Carol,"Little Rock, AR","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2018",I was looking for a refinance with a cash back option to get off some debt and get a roof put on my house because my insurance wouldn't cover me on that. I went online then I accidentally pushed a button that I might be interested in a mortgage. I immediately got a phone call from a big company in Michigan and they were predatory. I spent a bit of time on the phone with them and I realized that it was a good time to go and have a refinance. The company was pushing me fast to sign up with them and I didn’t like it. Other people started calling too. I did Google searches for best mortgage companies and read people’s reviews. I saw that people were able to get the best rate from AmeriSave. ,5
Ali,"Detroit, MI","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2018","I wanted to refinance and I chose to go with AmeriSave because of the rates. Obtaining the mortgage was fast and easy and the application and underwriting process took around over a month and it was simple to do online. But as soon as the mortgage deal was done, I was notified a week later that somebody else was servicing the loan. They sold the loan to PHE Mortgage whom I never heard of and they’re servicing alone so I really don’t know much about them. AmeriSave is a good company to go with, but they most likely will not service the loan. I wish they could handle the loan more versus transferring it to somebody once it was all set and done. But the rest of my experience with them was pretty good.",4
Mark,"Eugene, OR","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2018","A couple of years ago, I used AmeriSave for a refinance. They were very accommodating then and they met my needs. Then I needed to pay off a few credit card bills and I reached back out for the loan processor that assisted me in the last one. She was very helpful and understanding. She knew my past history so it made things a little bit easier, smoother and I felt I was in good hands. ",5
Daniela,"Salt Lake City, UT","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2018","I used AmeriSave previously and I was happy with them but I needed a certain criteria to take advantage of in the state of Utah. The local one was able to meet those requirements AmeriSave wouldn't, so I proceeded with the original lender. However, when I was getting a quote for the interest rate, they were unusually high. I went on AmeriSave’s website just to compare the interest rates and it could have triggered an email to the same loan officer I used in the past. The loan officer was very good. He came up with a different plan that was financially better for me and stayed on top of all the deadlines which was one of my concerns. He was quite proactive. I switched lenders halfway through the process and AmeriSave made the opportunity to close one week before the deadline. They were extremely efficient and it was 100% excellent service.",5
Jerome,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2018","I wanted to refinance and to take some money out of the house and it was easier to do it with AmeriSave Mortgage. When I went online, they had a chart and it showed all the different rates, different terms, and different costs. It was all spelled out right there and it made it a lot easier to go through it and to make up my mind and decide what term I wanted. There were all kinds of things involved in the points I had to pay and it also made it easier. None of the other places did that. The online application process wasn’t that difficult and the reps were knowledgeable. They led us through the process. The woman that I dealt with was very patient and very helpful. She understood that I had refinanced before, but I never did it online. I went over all the options and I was very pleased with the what I ended up with. The rate was a little higher than what my past mortgage was but not that much.",5
Robert,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2018","AmeriSave was the first company I talked to when I was looking at mortgages. The application online was fine but every night, we had to send a lot of data through fax. The rep was very professional and he answered my questions. He was very helpful in that way. The application and underwriting process took three weeks and we got the loan closed with AmeriSave. However, two days later, they sold us to another company to take care of the loan.",3
Kimberly,"Salt Lake City, UT","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2018","We needed to do some home improvement and we ran into Amerisave. Their rep called us back and talked to us about getting a mortgage.

They were quite comparable to other people. Overall, Amerisave  did a great job.",5
Paula,"Richmond, VA","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2018","AmeriSave was the best. They called me first, so I worked with them over the other lenders. We had to do the application online and then we had to do it with a notary. It was fine to do online because we could take our time and read it. We got all the things together for the refinance over a period of 10 days because we were doing it piecemeal.",5
John,"Shreveport, LA","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2018","I was looking to lower my monthly payments. I heard good things about AmeriSave and chose to go with them. The application and underwriting took about a week and it was a very smooth and easy process. The AmeriSave reps were very helpful and knowledgeable and they easily answered all the questions I had. I could call or e-mail them and they would get back with me within a few minutes. I’m happy with the mortgage I received. The rate was better and they were also one of the easier companies I've ever worked with. It was a pleasant transaction on my end, and I would recommend AmeriSave to others.",5
Nicholas,"Richmond, VA","Reviewed Sept. 12, 2018","I wanted to get rid of the PMI and I talked to a gentleman from AmeriSave. He sounded very honest and knew what he was talking about. I enjoyed working with him because he was knowledgeable about rates and getting rid of the PMI. Everything was online and I called one weekend to see where we were. Another gentleman answered on a weekend and he wanted to reroute the whole mortgage again. So, he cut the other guy out that I was originally talking to. I wrote a letter about that to my mortgage broker who shared it with his boss. That was kinda weird and I have never had that happen. Everything was okay till point and you can follow up with them. They ironed everything out but it set a bad flavor. ",2
Anzel,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2018","AmeriSave was good in explaining everything and the process took a week. It was very good dealing with the reps and they were very professional. If I had to, I would do it again.",5
Douglas,"Wichita, KS","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2018",We did this on my sister and my brother-in-law’s house and it looked like AmeriSave Mortgage was the best company to go with. I talked to Roger and Maegan and they were very helpful. The online application process was great. We were able to figure everything at my brother-in-law’s laptop. We didn’t have to run around the different institutions and fill out different forms. We expected about three weeks for the application and underwriting process but we got them a little sooner.  ,5
Cliff,"Tacoma, WA","Reviewed Sept. 11, 2018","I used AmeriSave previously and when I relocated to a different area for a new job, I applied for a new loan. The application process was not too bad but towards the end, there were a lot of last-minute things that they asked for that were within six days to close. Nevertheless, the customer service people worked with me fine and I was able to find all the information. Also, the rates and terms were good. It was easy to work with the stuff online in terms of providing the information but make sure you have all your ducks in a row because they would ask for a lot of different things periodically depending on your situation.",4
David,"Alhambra, CA","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2018","We found Andrew ** and Nikki ** to be informative, patient, thorough and professional. We were grateful for their conduct and recognize them as assets to AmeriSave. We have already recommended Andrew and AmeriSave to our colleagues. Cheers and thank you.",5
Jason,"Baltimore, MD","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2018","AmeriSave had rates and terms that were at par with the other lenders that we looked at, but since they came as a referral, we decided to go with them. We did a conventional loan with them and the online application process was easy. Also, their reps were clear, concise and up-to-date. The whole process took 21 days and was done in a timely manner.",5
S.,"Wa, WA","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2018","I inherited money, so I decided to pay off my car, which left me with $400. I decided to add to my mortgage payments. I was refinancing from a 25-year mortgage down to an 18-year and so, I was gonna pay more but I had the money to do that. AmeriSave, which was my current mortgage lender, had the best deal. The point they quoted ended up being higher but since the interest rate was below the current rates, that made sense. The online application process was good and convenient. I checked the emails and if they needed something, I could reply by email to them so that saved a lot of phone calls. The paperwork was right there. I couldn’t scan it back but I could copy things off that I needed. ",5
Sabrina,"New York, NY","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2018","I had an FHA and I wanted to get rid of the mortgage interest. AmeriSave's rate was very transparent. By putting in my minimal personal information through their website, I was able to get a really good estimate of what my rate would be and my monthly payment. My only issue is that it was very difficult to reach people over the phone when I needed them at that moment. The folks are busy so they have to do a lot of callback. But everything else was good. I’m very happy with their rates and terms. The customer service was also great. I felt fairly comfortable working with them and I would recommend them.",5
Joy,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2018","I looked for the best prices and came up with AmeriSave. And they turned out to be really good. The online application process was great and the guy that we used was excellent. He was communicative and on the mark. We went over the different rates and points and how I could buy up to the very beginning. I had chosen one and he thought it was the best one given our circumstances. So he knew what he was talking about. We buy houses a lot so we knew what we were doing and we had all our ducks in a row. So AmeriSave just had to verify our stuff and that was it. But he was also on top of everything to make it happen within 15 days. We closed this property then. All in all, it was a good and easy process, and the terms were very good. AmeriSave did a very good job.",5
Steven,"San Mateo, CA","Reviewed Sept. 9, 2018","The reps from Amerisave were all reasonable and forthright. It was a pleasurable experience. Their online application process worked pretty well. I was pretty satisfied with the overall experience. If this is the way they do business generally and my experience is a representative of how they interact with other people, I would recommend Amerisave to other folks.",5
William,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed Sept. 9, 2018","Everything went smoothly with AmeriSave the last time I worked with them and so, it was time to go with them again. I reached out to Rebecca, the person I worked with previously. I sent her an email and then she got the ball rolling. She showed me the rates and all the different options, and went over what my best options would be, cost-wise. I selected a rate for refinancing. A lot of my information was already on file so they could pull everything offline. Their customer service was excellent. They made a follow-up quickly and they were very responsive to any questions I had. I considered good everything about them. We closed quickly and it was after hours that we got the whole process done in the first place, and so I was pleased with the timing and everything about it. People should look into them. They are gonna sell you a loan but the same rates and everything applies for that. AmeriSave is a good company and their rates make sense.",5
Gary,"Mesa, AZ","Reviewed Sept. 9, 2018","I did some shopping and made some phone calls, and I had a very pleasant experience. The AmeriSave personnel that I spoke and dealt with from the chief guy and the various secretaries who worked with him were all great. I got a 30-year fixed loan for our daughter’s new home and everything went smoothly. The rates are always too high like your grocery bill or gasoline but our plan is to refinance perhaps in a year down the road and do better. I appreciated their helpfulness and comfort.",5
Sandy,"Elizabeth, NJ","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2018","AmeriSave were the ones who answered back first and they were customer friendly. So I refinanced with them for a lower amount of years. Their online application process was very simple and everything was cut-and-dry. Everyone was also pretty much on top of everything. If ever I had any questions, they would return my phone call within a day or within hours. That was a very big deal and I was very comfortable working with them. They were very helpful in anything that I needed help with. The rate was satisfactory as well and I felt it could have been a little bit lower. But as far as the terms of the loan, they were pretty good.",5
Carla,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2018",I bought a house. We got a mortgage from AmeriSave because of their closing cost. Everything went very smoothly with the process and they did an excellent job. I would refer them.,5
Seth,"Memphis, TN","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2018","I wanted to save and AmeriSave had a competitive rate. The online application process was extremely detailed and the paperwork was way more than I wanna do but it was fine. Robert, the rep, was knowledgeable about the process which took 30 days. He was sharp on the numbers and detailed about everything. He took the time after-hours to answer questions that I had. Overall, it was a good experience.",4
Dennis,"Redding, CA","Reviewed Sept. 8, 2018","AmeriSave's initial quote was the lowest. I refinanced with them and we did two homes with 20-year mortgages. The process was smooth and very organized. Everything was online, so we just had to upload our documents. I worked with Grant, the loan officer, to make sure everything was on time. Grant was very good and on top of things. He checked with me almost every morning. I would get an email report and, then, if needed, he would give me a call. Once we got the file from AmeriSave, we had to go through and upload all the confirming documentation. ",5
Gloria,"Hartford, CT","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2018","AmeriSave responded to me and what they offered seemed to work. The rate was fair but I was hoping for a little bit less. The application process took two months. It could be a little bit shorter, but it wasn't that bad. It was seamless. Also, they could eliminate some of the paperwork that they ask for or there could be a quicker way of being able to do it by making some of the information verbal. Other than that, the rep I worked with was very helpful. He was checking on me continuously which I appreciated. AmeriSave is a good company. They worked with me well. I would recommend them.",5
Katherine,"Concord, CA","Reviewed Sept. 7, 2018","I wanted to buy a home. I looked into getting a new mortgage and since AmeriSave's rate was the lowest, I went with them. Also, my father used them in buying a previous home and had a good experience with it. I got a 30 year fixed rate loan and obtaining it was fairly easy. I applied online then I was contacted by their rep. We worked through any additional information needed in the loan process and I was assisted by Lauren. He kinda took care of mostly everything. He was very responsive and he checked up on me once every other day to see if we needed any additional documentation. ",4

I finished in about a couple of days then I went thru complete underwriting for about a week. I’m very impressed with their lending process and I didn’t see any problem. Also, their loan officers were very responsive and very professional. My underwriters were Clayton and Robert and I was impressed with them. They knew what they were doing and I was comfortable working with them. The rates and terms of the loan are competitive and they can always be better. But I worked with other lenders and I like AmeriSave the most. I would recommend them.",5
Darrell,"Roswell, GA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2018","But other than that, AmeriSave's refinancing process was relatively simple. I had all the information that their rep needed and within a month, I was refinanced. The application and underwriting process took about three weeks and AmeriSave's reps were awesome! The terms of my loan are good and my interest rate went up a little bit, which I wasn't really happy about, but I understood that and overall, I'm happy with everything. I had a quick and easy experience with them and I didn't have a problem.",5
Michelle,"Cincinnati, OH","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2018","We were purchasing a condo and when I was shopping for rates, AmeriSave was one of the companies I called. Their rate ended up being the best deal for us. The online application process was good and the whole thing was closed within a month. The timing was good but I was very disappointed with the loan officer because he started out real friendly, but once we decided to go with them, I didn't hear a word from him. There were some issues and he didn't help at all. So, I was totally dealing with the processor who was very good about getting back to us. However, she was limited because of what she knows. We had some issues because we were buying up in Ohio. My husband was there and I was down here, and we wanted to put me on the title. We thought we had done everything we needed to do, and I was talking to the processor about it. It turned out they wouldn't let the title company put me on the loan title. ",2

Adam,"Richmond, VA","Reviewed Sept. 4, 2018","I wanted to drop down the monthly payment and AmeriSave provided less origination fee for the loan. I applied online and I received many offers but I got with the one that fit my needs. I got a 10-year adjustable loan and the process took 30-45 days. It seemed that the guy I worked with didn’t have much experience and he looked like he was new to the process. In the beginning, AmeriSave said that there was no appraisal for the house because it was new. Then, they changed their mind and said that appraisal was required. In the beginning of the loan application, there was no need to pay the tax or there was no escrow account at all. Then at the end, when they quoted me for the monthly payment, it was included which was confusing. It shouldn't have happened but it was not a bad experience to deal with AmeriSave. You should just have everything documented.",4
Kaleab,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed Sept. 3, 2018","I got a new mortgage because I just bought my first house. The first person I talked to at AmeriSave was Zeinab and I liked her personality.

We spoke over the phone and then everything was done online. The pre-qualification was done in one day and same thing with the pre-approval. It took them about 10 days to set up all the paperwork like they told me. It was fast and amazing. They were done and then we waited for the closing date, and they did it way before the deadline. Their reps were very polite and very patient. My experience was fantastic and I already recommended AmeriSave to my friends. I work in an insurance company and there were about four customers who already talked and closed with them and four are still in process.",5

They didn't flood me with calls and they were extremely polite. I was dealing with Quicken at the time and I hadn't decided yet who I was going to use. I purposely asked a question I knew I'd get the answer back on and David from AmeriSave answered correctly, whereas Quicken was just out to get my $400,000 loan. They were the worst experience ever.

I was able to finish everything and he was my point of contact until everything got turned over to loan processing. Nicky, my loan processor, was a Johnny-on-the-spot. I got called at eight o'clock in the morning and I haven't even read my email yet. The process was fast and painless as long as I'm willing to get everything uploaded and done.

I didn't understand the difference of signing things that I thought I had already signed. But I would quickly email and ask what was up, and Tim would send me a message back to let me know why.

Leo,"Phoenix, AZ","Reviewed Aug. 31, 2018","I knew I was not gonna do Wells Fargo anymore and when I looked up mortgages, I saw AmeriSave. I called them and checked them out. There was no problem and I’m glad I went with them. The process didn’t take long at all and the underwriter didn’t need a lot of information compared to others. He needed only a couple of extra things done and it was all set up. So, that was excellent. Bryan, the first gentleman I dealt with, was excellent. I got ahold of him and he called me right away because we wanted to get on top of things. AmeriSave gets the job done, they would get your mortgage qualified and get you all set up in a timely manner. They also had the best interest rates at the time.

Brent in particular was very helpful and very patient. He assisted us through the whole process. When he was off or when he was not at work, he was available to talk to us about the loan.

AmeriSave sent out alerts letting me know if there was something needed from me or if something new had been added to my file. Handling the process and working my way through it was very easy.

Laurie,"Dayton, NV","Reviewed July 17, 2018","I obtained a referral to AmeriSave through ConsumerAffairs when I took a short survey about my needs and situation. I am so grateful I followed through. AmeriSave has the best online information about loan configurations and interest rates that I have ever seen. Within minutes of entering basic information, I immediately received a wide array of loan options. I was skeptical, but it was not a bait and switch. The initial information was accurate and nothing changed through the whole process. The loan originator and the loan processor were both awesome - responsive, friendly, knowledgeable, thorough and determined to make the experience as easy as possible. ",5

Mark,"Nicholasville, KY","Reviewed May 3, 2018","I had a variable rate mortgage and needed to refinance. Their application is pretty much standard and I did it all online. Their website gives you options if you want to pay for points in closing. The appraisal is straightforward and relatively easy and that is why I chose to do it again. I have used AmeriSave a couple times before.The application took a half an hour and the underwriting, a couple days. I have got excellent credit, so the application process sailed through. Also, Chris, the guy doing the underwriting and coordinating, was efficient. He was competent and he communicated well. Everything went off according to schedule. My loan officer John was experienced and professional, too. The thing that I like about those guys, unlike some of the others, is that they do not badger with phone calls.  The rate I got from them was competitive in the market.",5

They’ve already switched me to two other companies for loan now. Still, I would recommend AmeriSave.",5
Dwight,"Perris, CA","Reviewed May 1, 2018","I went on Lending Tree to acquire a mortgage and then I got a call from AmeriSave, who sounded like they knew what they were doing so I decided to go ahead with them. AmeriSave's rates were compatible with what I was getting from all these companies. It was pretty much right there with what everybody else was trying to get me to have. I already own the house but I needed some funds to do some improvements on the house, like the master bathroom as we wanted to retile them and put a new carpet in there. So I took out a loan for 100,000 as I figured that would cover everything.",5

At the end of the day, they were able to get me the lowest interest rate and were able to lock it in at a time where it was going up every week. It could’ve been lower, but I’m very happy with what it is currently compared to what it could’ve been. The online application process was simple, easy and straightforward. And, together with the underwriting process, it took four weeks to finish. ",5
Jeffery,"Roanoke, VA","Reviewed April 29, 2018","I was looking to refinance and get rid of some debt so I went to a site where they send your information out to several lenders and you get calls from those who are competing for your business. AmeriSave had the best rate and terms and the service process was of little to no fee. Also, the whole process took two weeks. They were very easy to deal with and if there were any questions, they were quick to respond. The online portal that we operated out of kept everything up-to-date and you were well-notified on what was required, what had been submitted and where everything stood. So, everything was smooth with no issues.",5
Shannon,"Lutz, FL","Reviewed April 29, 2018","When we had gotten our mortgage 13 years ago, we already owned a home in Minnesota and we ended up having to get a really bad mortgage. It was a 10-year interest only, balloon payment. Before we’d gotten to the 10-year point, we were planning on refinancing, but the housing market collapsed and I got divorced. I finally got to the point where I could refinance on my own, and Amerisave Mortgage seemed to have the best rate. At the time, I had been thinking about doing it for a while. On that particular day, I had enough nerve to do it, I clicked on that particular thing and all the stars aligned.",4
Stephanie,"Butler, AL","Reviewed April 28, 2018","I liked AmeriSave's rates and I had a great experience with them. I applied for a refi and their loan process was pretty good, very easy, and convenient. I did everything online through email and their website would let me upload documents and esign everything. Their reps also seemed friendly every time I spoke with them, very thorough with what they needed, and made things simple. Plus, they were very quick to answer back if I email them or have questions. They would try to call but a lot of times I was at work and would not read my phone.",5
Daniel,"Lehi, UT","Reviewed April 27, 2018","I needed a refi and Amerisave looked good. The process was easy and they explained everything. Everything was online, so was really easy to use. That was mainly why I went with them. The application and underwriting process took a couple of weeks to be completed. However, I should have been able to get a lot better rate considering my credit rating, even though I don’t really care about the rate. I’ll pay it off early anyway. I wasn’t happy with that part of it and the rep should’ve done more to explain that part, which would have been helpful. Nevertheless, I am pleased with the terms. Amerisave is all really good. I’d recommend them.",5
Leonard,"Greensboro, NC","Reviewed April 27, 2018","I was trying to replace an adjustable rate mortgage with the fixed rate for the remaining period of time I thought I would need. AmeriSave offered the best deal and was easiest to work with from comparing different alternatives, so I went with them. Their application process was relatively easy in part because I purchased a second home rental property about five months before for which I also went through the online mortgage application process. So, that was helpful and I was a little familiar with it. Then, I found out that AmeriSave's process was not to collect every available piece of data and back up information, but to be a little more minimalistic and go after just what was needed. That made the process somewhat simpler and there was less stuff to collect. All in all, things worked out and I was satisfied.",5
Sharon,"Saint Paul, MN","Reviewed April 26, 2018","I started talking to Drew from AmeriSave Mortgage and he did an excellent job. He was so informative, great and helpful. Moreover, he wasn’t pushy. I had checked one other company and they just kept calling back and asking if I was going to do it. I was very comfortable and I really enjoyed working with Drew. We were on the phone and he walked me through everything step-by-step while I was on my computer. If there was any information I needed, he answered me right away. I even have his cell phone number and he said to call him anytime. I took an FHA where the rates don't go up and down. The process went really fast really for me and the rates were great compared to what I had before, which was 7.5%. Now, I'm at 4% and I'm saving 350 bucks a month. If I knew anybody that wants a mortgage, I’d recommend Drew.",5
Roca,"Falls Church, VA","Reviewed April 26, 2018","We were refinancing and we did a lot of research. From a total of 12 different banks and financial institutions, AmeriSave was the best one. The online application was a little arduous but the online platform was very easy to use in downloading, uploading documents and tracking everything which was pretty good. We interacted with two different people. Sebastian was the front person and he was excellent. He did a stellar job in terms of following up and explaining the process to us. It was the first time we were doing a transaction like that so there was a lot of explanation needed. It was good to understand what we have to go through, the necessary kind of documents that were needed and the lead times for producing documents. ",5
Pablo,"Houston, TX","Reviewed April 25, 2018","AmeriSave Mortgage process has been an experience that I would like to rate as extraordinary due to the knowledge of the team members associated with my loan, providing concise and clear information of each step in the process.

Calvin,"Topeka, KS","Reviewed April 25, 2018","It was time for me to refinance and the interest rate from 2009 was higher.

AmeriSave Mortgage offered the best package in terms of their flexibility with the monthly cost and their rate was the strongest of all that I looked at. Also, their customer service was the best of everybody I talked to. They’re very responsive and their application process online was seamless. I finished it in about two hours and closed the refinance in just a couple of weeks. I was happy with the lending process.",5

I ended up buying another one and after that, he just turned to me when I was preoccupied and transferred me to Rob. It was a very smooth process which took a little less than a month. ",5
V.,"Wa, WA","Reviewed April 24, 2018","I liked my previous experience with Amerisave and their low rates. I went with their 20 years fixed loan program for an investment. I was using their online system and the process took about four weeks. The reps were helpful and were able to find good options. There was good communication with Victoria and Matt and the rate was very competitive. However, after I closed, I started to receive a lot of spam that originated from AmeriSave advertising additional deals. That's definitely not needed and that didn't look very professional. They sent lots of mail to my addresses and all of them were scary. Everything was awesome until then.",5
Mateo,"Destin, FL","Reviewed April 24, 2018","I did a Google search for lenders and AmeriSave was one of the ones that came up and also they weren’t one of the ones that pressured me to start the paperwork right away. It was easy obtaining a loan from them. They gave me the stuff that I needed to fill up. Anytime I had to fill in anything, they’ll either give me a call or shoot me an email telling me I had more documents that I needed to sign and fill up. It was painless and relatively fast. It took a month and I have no complaints about how they did it. They did a good job. The first rep I spoke with walked me through the whole process as easy as it can be. He would even answer my calls on the weekend when I had a question. The rate of the loan was a little bit high but that comes with the territory with my score. All the people from AmeriSave were good and everybody I had contact with was very professional and fast.",5

While I was looking for a house and found one, I had to quickly find a mortgage lender. I shopped around for a company that I thought would give me the best deal and I saw that AmeriSave was very competitive with their rate. Even the other lenders, they couldn’t touch what AmeriSave could do for me. I appreciated that they were able to give me a good rate as well as my interest rate. When you work hard and your credit is good and you work your way up to a certain status, that is a good thing that AmeriSave will appreciate back too. I also thought that at the time, I was lucky to lock into a very good rate because now, we’re in a vulnerable market where rates are going up and down.",5

Robert,"Orange, CA","Reviewed April 20, 2018","I was looking to refinance and AmeriSave has the best rate. Paul was my loan officer and I was impressed by his professionalism and willingness to walk me through and provide guidance. It was very easy to reach out and communicate with Paul. I went with a 30-year fixed program and the online application process was very convenient, user-friendly, and easy to use. I find having to sign papers, getting the credit approved, and locking in my rate before any discussion occurred somewhat annoying. Also, I'm not a big fan of getting notified a week or two after the loan was funded that they've already sold it off but I assumed it would happen and I understand these are all part of the business. And with the rates and terms of the mortgage I received, I couldn't find a better one. I would recommend AmeriSave.",5

Moreover, the loan agents that were assigned to our account were great. They wanted us to be able to get it done without any hassle and they did their best to make that happen.

The process, from beginning to end, took a couple of weeks. It was quick, which was one of the reasons that I was glad we went with them rather than our bank. The process is six to eight weeks through the bank, compared with two weeks with them. So it was way easier. I dealt with Brandon, the loan officer, and then I worked with a gal towards the end.

I understand that it goes through a lot of processes so I feel like that’s the right amount of days for the mortgage to get through.

They should have been honest upfront that there’s going to be a lot of work involved with it and not advertise that it’s going to be the easiest thing in the world; or they could do away with some of the documentation and make the process easier. Also they need to update their website where they do the process through. I was able open it in some systems and then when I click something, it disappeared. So, in the end, the guy just started emailing me the documentation as opposed to using their website. Still, everybody I dealt with was friendly and easy to work with. The rate and terms I got were good as well.",3
Adnan,"Boca Raton, FL","Reviewed April 7, 2018","I was looking for a refi at that time and AmeriSave called me. I liked the conversation that I had with the agent, which was kind of assuring, so I went with them. Their online application process was very good and the whole process took a few weeks. Two of the representatives were there and both were professional and were good. The initial gentleman was Anthony and the loan processor was Kelly. My experience with AmeriSave Mortgage was good. In fact, I just spoke with the same agent yesterday and he made an application for me in buying a new house so I’m still working with AmeriSave. This is my second deal supposedly and we shall see.",4
Lucinda,"Nampa, ID","Reviewed April 7, 2018","I got a refinance and went with AmeriSave since they don't charge any fees. The process was fine and they were fast. However, since they wanna send a bunch of stuff through email, they should let me know that first because I'm not a person that messes with my email. I'd rather have a phone call than an email because I don't check my emails. A lot of my email from them went into junk and so I had a terrible time finding it. I also thought the rates were a little high, but they were the same as the other person I was dealing with before, so it was fine.",4
Anthony,"Santa Ana, CA","Reviewed April 6, 2018","I wanted to refinance and was referred to Amerisave Mortgage by a friend. Once I got into the process with AmeriSave, it was really easy and worked great, so I just went forth with them. The online application process was really good and streamlined. The dashboard was really easy to use. It figured out what I needed and what they needed. It was a good platform. I was on top of everything and gave all the information quickly. Within a week we were almost done with the process of getting the escrow. I went with a cash-out refinance. It was a 30-year fixed standard loan and their rates were competitive. ",5
Rod,"Loyal, WI","Reviewed April 6, 2018","I was with Wells Fargo and their rates were high. We called them first and they felt like they were rushing things too much. We googled online and I remember seeing TV ads on Lending Tree. I put my name in there and then had a dozen calls. AmeriSave was the kindest and they were patient. They made sure that every one of our questions was answered. They weren’t rushing through anything. I checked out a couple of the other ones and I felt rushed. They also weren’t trying to look out for me. And as far as rates and the years, it seemed like they were looking out for them more than us. But Amerisave won overall.",5
Nathan,"Lafayette, IN","Reviewed April 5, 2018","AmeriSave Mortgage's terms were extremely reasonable.

My loan origination person was really great, really accommodating, very good on the communication part and he was awesome too. Everyone there really treated me with respect.",3

Getting our rate lock was easy, and then it's been downhill from there. They want information that NO OTHER LENDER wants, and then they want explanations for it! They blame it on Fannie Mae but our realtor and our investigation confirmed that they are lying. Unless they improve their ways, we will never use them again. NOTE: Upon seeing this review, I was contacted immediately. If things are resolved quickly, I will circle back and update my review and rating. Fingers crossed!",1
Randy,"Canton, MI","Reviewed April 2, 2018","AmeriSave's online application process was simple, extremely thorough and helpful to walk through. It also took only 15 to 20 minutes to complete. We've moved to eight different houses and this is the first time I've refinanced but it was the smoothest mortgage finance experience I've ever had. I wanted to pay as little as possible or not pay at all in closing and they had some of the best offers in that regard. I knew rates were going to be going up and I wanted to get in before that actually hurt, and their rates were simply competitive combined with the offset of the closing cost. That's why I chose them.

Aynalem,"Snellville, GA","Reviewed March 31, 2018","I wanted to remove my 20 percent mortgage insurance to get free 20 percent because I did minimum three percent deposit. So, with two days monthly, Amerisave Mortgage told me I’m going to get the mortgage insurance free. The process of obtaining my mortgage was really good and very simple. I signed up and did the application process online. They gave me what information I needed and I sent it out through email. The application and the underwriting process took three weeks to one month. I started on the first of January and I closed by February 4 or 5. The Amerisave Mortgage lending processor was helpful and knowledgeable and she explained the advantage and the disadvantage. The rate and terms of the mortgage are a bit high, but it’s not bad because when I compared to the advantage of the carrier, it’s not too much higher. The interest is going down, so that way, I’m benefited.",5
Diane,"Oregon City, OR","Reviewed March 30, 2018","Ever since the economy crash, my husband and I have been working to pay the mortgage and save money. We contacted a referral company who gave us the names of three mortgagors, including Amerisave. In the first conversation with the loan officer, my husband said we have only six months of cash reserves, and asked what their policy was. The loan officer didn't answer his question, but pressured us to get all the necessary paperwork to him quickly, which we did. After reviewing the documents and checking our credit scores, my husband was told by the loan officer that we were basically pre-approved for a ""jumbo"" loan at 4.5%; all we needed was an appraisal to prove that we have enough equity in our home. We paid the $775 appraisal fee that they required, and the appraiser was diligent about showing up on Wednesday, March 28, at the appointed time. ",1

Their application process was great. They had a standard set of rates they sent over and I can look at it right online. That was something that anybody can look at and it wasn’t a question of what was going on or what was included or not. I didn’t have to wait to really find out what I was looking at. ",5

They were also very accommodating. Also, I liked that the document exchange has been very fluid. I worked with David and then a gentleman named Glen. They were willing to listen and they were accessible. Especially when as a buyer, you're eager to get certain things. And when you have somebody making you comfortable or telling you how it is, it just makes things so much easier. It's almost like a trust. The whole process took about three weeks. ",5
Charles,"Buford, GA","Reviewed March 30, 2018","I was looking to get out from underneath the PMI and when Brad from AmeriSave called, I had a good response from him and then I went with a refi. The application and underwriting process took a couple of weeks and it went well. Brad was more than helpful and informative. Dealing with him from start to finish had been great. However, a guy named James had some subordinate gaining the information from the HOA and we had no common areas. And he wasn’t following up with it. He would contact me saying that I haven’t done this or this haven’t been provided when it had been provided probably a week or so earlier. But when I contacted Brad about it, he resolved it and they were able to close the whole deal three days later. He moved through to get it done. If I had to deal with James one more time, I would have switched companies. Brad is the only reason that saved the account from not switching over.",4
Donald,"Deer Lodge, MT","Reviewed March 29, 2018","I looked into mortgage to refinance, lower interest rate and lower the length of the term. I had been with Quicken Loans for quite a while and I checked rates across the board and was drawn to AmeriSave with their low rates. The process took five weeks. It went quicker than what I was expecting and when I had financed through Quicken Loans in the past. And I know they did everything they could. They made things work and there were no real hang-ups. After they got the appraisal back, credit check, and employment verification, I liked it. I'm happy with the whole process. They were efficient, kept in contact with me, and let me know we were getting close. And whenever they needed additional information, I got it to them and they responded right back and said, ""Okay, we got it."" They're easier and more efficient than Quicken Loans.",5

Brian,"Washington, DC","Reviewed March 29, 2018","Refinancing with AmeriSave was very smooth and relatively easy and the team that I worked with was well-coordinated through email and phone call and through their website as well. Their employees, Jordan and Nikki, were very good at what they did. The whole process took a month because we had to get an appraisal and then walked through the house. Their website is not quite as sleek in some ways compared to Quicken’s and Rocket Mortgage’s websites, but it still worked and AmeriSave was ethical and quick. They weren't reaching over backward to be the lowest in terms of rate, but the rate I received was fair. Overall, my experience had been straightforward and right on target and I would recommend AmeriSave.",5

From there, we communicated a lot through email, which was nice because it was at our convenience. It was straightforward. Initially, I had my husband on the application. But he doesn't believe in credit, so I had to redo the application to put me on it. The application itself seemed pretty long and the underwriting took a while. They needed a lot of information to confirm the loan and I didn't have them all in front of me so I had to get them. I was okay with it since they were letting me use a lot of money so they wanted to make sure that I have the ability to pay it back.",5

It was just like a harassment and add 50,000 things but I wasn’t looking for 50 years. I went with a 30-year fixed with Amerisave. The online application was great. It took less than a month for it to finish. I did it on the 31st of January. It was the first time I called them and I’d close my loan within three weeks. It was a good experience for me. ",5

Their rep, Leon, understood what it took to get everything done and told me the things I needed to do to get things going.

I rate shopped and compared the closing cost and felt that James and Haley would be the best people to process my requirements. Haley was really on top of things. If I had a question about something, I submitted it online and I got an answer back, usually via email or through the online process.

It is always tough to sit down and go through some of the stuff, where I can just log on and do it online and make it really simple. Plus, he gave me numbers to call if I needed to.",5
Robert,"Riverview, FL","Reviewed March 21, 2018","We had a 30-year mortgage and we wanted to reduce that to 15 years. We scouted with some different mortgage companies and selected the information AmeriSave gave us. We refinanced with them and ended up going with a 20 year. I did the application process online, downloaded whatever the application was and responded to the information that I needed to. Their reps walked us through the procedure, contacted us and corresponded back and forth. They gave us all the questions and answers and got back to us by the minute. When they went over the rate or the terms of the mortgage, it was fine with us. In two weeks, all was set and done with everything. I was very pleased with the way they handled themselves with the entire operation and I would refer them to a friend of mine.",5
Jack,"Lenoir, NC","Reviewed March 20, 2018","AmeriSave Mortgage had the best deal as far as the interest rates and the amount of the payment that was going to be and a few things that seemed to be better than some of the other ones. I got a VA loan from them. The rate I got was the same rate I had at the time before. The terms were what I asked for. I did the majority of the application process online and over the telephone. It was quite easy and it took 35 days to complete. My loan guy, Todd, was the one I dealt with the majority of the time. We got along just great. He had quick answers and helped me do everything. He saved me a lot of time paperwork-wise by them getting the papers they needed instead of me having to fax it to them. That was the first time I’ve ever done that where I didn’t have to sit there in the fax machine and send 40 pieces of papers. I was happy and satisfied with AmeriSave. They would be a good company to go with.",5
Lance,"Baker City, OR","Reviewed March 20, 2018","I went on a site and I filled out the stuff and Amerisave was on the phone in about 10 seconds. They sent stuff that we had to sign and we went through the process. It was easy and took about three weeks, but most of that was waiting for the appraiser to show up in this small county. Kevin, much like any salesman, was aggressive, but once I got him on my page, he waited for me to take the lead, which was good. The rate looked good compared to other people so I was happy. Moreover, their customer service was good stuff. They were right there for everything.",5
John,"La Plata, MD","Reviewed March 20, 2018","Amerisave has the lowest interest rates. Their online application was simple and easy but they took a while to get some of the information.

I went with their 15-year fixed loan program.",5

I have worked with Quicken Loans and they made it more complex. Whereas AmeriSave just made it easy for me and it wasn't stressful. After I have filled out the application online, Thomas contacted me and led me through the first aspect. He was the sales rep and was very positive. And then, Ricky was very precise and got things done. He was the actual processor who led me through the second process. When I was struggling to get the paperwork together, Ricky would go and get it himself. He made everything a lot less stressful. ",5

He's also a gentleman and was very responsive. I had called him before but then, I backed out on the application. Then this year, I decided the time is right and the equity is right so I called him back again because I like him well enough that I thought I could trust him. The online application process was complicated though. You have so many things to approve and sign electronically. The computer work is what it is and sending them copies of everything they want was deep. In fact, I had a back and forth on the telephone with Alan and then emailing him. ",5

Vincent,"Katy, TX","Reviewed March 19, 2018","Obtaining a mortgage through AmeriSave was quick. They were very efficient so we stuck with them. We spoke to the loan officer and we were comfortable with what he provided. It fits what we were doing so we went ahead with it. However, there was a glitch in our appraisal. It came back high and then for some reason, the underwriter looked at it and told us that’s not what it was and that the appraiser forgot to include some area of the property that was supposed to be included in the appraisal. That was disappointing. ",4
Renate,"Leonard, MI","Reviewed March 18, 2018","My experience with AmeriSave Mortgage was good. I have noticed, though, that they have resold the mortgage already, so hopefully that wouldn't become an issue. AmeriSave didn't allow automatic deductions through my account and I had to log into a website to do that. But now that they've transferred the mortgage to another company, I'm hoping that the company to which they've resold the mortgage has something like this. Other than that, AmeriSave was quick in their service and they got the refinance done by their closing date, to a secured date. If you're unsure about refinancing, make sure that you talk with one of their specialists because he clarified it in detail and did the breakdown. We weren't sure if we should utilize AmeriSave and which options to go with, but they had the experts and they had good rates.",5

We just kept working to the point where it all worked out. They worked really fast and I really like that about them.

At that time, we had a project that we were getting ready to do, so we were looking into refinancing. Then I started doing some research and LendingTree popped up.

He then moved me over to a loan officer, and the next morning, I got the information I asked for. They moved me over to a lady rep that took me through the whole thing until the close. She was awesome. I always got a hold of her, she answered questions quickly and she didn't have to look for help to answer anything. She was very fast, efficient, professional and a great gal.

The application process of AmeriSave was simple and straightforward and the process of obtaining my mortgage went smoothly.

The comparables were very good with the different interest rates and closing cost. I felt so comfortable with him that we had to stop that first application, since I had to get a roof on my house before I got a loan.

He knew what he was doing and he totally loved his job. Lauren and Steven did a phenomenal job. They went over and above. During the underwriting process the company wanted way too much detailed information on previous stuff that didn’t really pertain to the loan. It was very tedious. If it wasn’t for Steven and Lauren I would not have closed with them. I would have walked somewhere else and paid more money.",5

And then, I talked to Randall from AmeriSave Mortgage and he told me all the facts right at the beginning. He was extremely upfront and nice. He didn't try to play any games that all the other companies try to play. And so I was like, ""He's the guy I need to go with."" He gave me a potential quote and sent me a website so I could see the different rates that I could choose from.

But some days, their rep would tell me I needed to do something and then two days later, he'd ask me to do something else which I already did. He should have asked for those things in the very beginning. When I thought that we were taking the step forward, then I had to do redo it again. Nevertheless, I would tell others to use AmeriSave, but they just have to make sure they ask the questions beforehand.

Moreover, I had great people who kept me on target and on track, as well as let me know what was going at all times with the refinance status. The whole process took about a month and a half, due to the fact that the VA appraiser took almost two and a half weeks to get the appraisal back. This was the first time I’ve ever been through it and I thought it was great from when we started to the very end. But you can get stressed out with trying to figure out the appraisal but they were great.",5
Edward,"Oceana, WV","Reviewed March 6, 2018","I applied for a loan with AmeriSave Mortgage online. It was convenient but I didn't like it. I had a lot of questions and I would rather just go in a couple of times in somebody's office and be done with the process. The whole process from start to finish was a long ordeal, longer than I expected. We started in August and it just wrapped up a few weeks ago. AmeriSave did everything. They sent an email and said, ""Hey, this is the day you're gonna close."" and it was done. If there was ever a question, all I had to do was send an email and their reps were prompt. Prompt is a day or two and that's good for me. The people were very professional, which I like. But there were some things that I should've asked but I didn't know how to ask during the whole process. It was a learning experience for me too.",4

I actually looked forward to Alan's calls to see what new piece of paper I would have to come up with next!!! Good news is papers that I had trouble obtaining, either Alan or Kelly were able to get for me!!! Their professionalism and great personalities went a long way in making an typically horrible task - dare I say - almost fun!!! I would recommend AmeriSave in a heartbeat!!!

It was AmeriSave's rep, Jordan, who I really liked. She was really knowledgeable and I like working with females. I got a couple of loans estimate quotes. I then checked a quote, brought it back to Amerisave, took Amerisave's quote to another company and I got the most comfortable result from Amerisave. So, I decided to go with them. And then I lied to the other company telling them that I lost my job so they would stop calling me.",5

AmeriSave had a competitive rate and I was able to work with someone which was more important to me.

I hated it when I got that impression. ",5
D.,"Tx, TX","Reviewed March 4, 2018","I looked into a mortgage for consolidating debt and shortening my loan term. I did price shopping on several sources. I went to my local bank, then to my existing mortgage company to inquire about refinance options through them. There's also a local refinance office in the metroplex that I inquired at. Once I have those rates to compare, I went to LendingTree to see what the national rates were and Amerisave was the only one that came in lower. I also glanced over some of the reviews on LendingTree but also Googled a few others and made sure it was pretty consistent. Amerisave's site came up, and they had good reviews. They ended up calling me, and since that was the company I was looking into, I went ahead, took the call, and followed their process. Once I got the information and felt confident, I decided to go with them versus the other two sources I'd considered. ",4

It was my first time so I was nervous about it, but with all the help, it went really well. It was a great experience. I really enjoyed both the people that I had communications with. All of the employees I dealt with, from the gal answering the phone to the customer service, were very helpful as far as getting me to the right person.

Vivek,"Gainesville, VA","Reviewed March 3, 2018","I refinanced my other house with AmeriSave Mortgage. I was new at the time but with AmeriSave, the prices were offhand which was very important.

Ultimately the loan went to one of the big banks so it was excellent to go with AmeriSave Mortgage. I made a new home purchase and made my second transaction with them.",4

And the people that sounded reasonably smart, I asked them to send me a list of their rates from 15-year, 30-year, 20-year mortgages and a variety of different rates and fees so that I could compare them against each other and make a decision. The folks from Amerisave were the quickest and most forthcoming. Everyone else wanted to talk to me again even though I asked them two or three times to just send me rates so I could compare. They didn’t do it so I went with Amerisave to I refinance my first mortgage. ",5
Vitali,"Gaithersburg, MD","Reviewed March 2, 2018",I tried different lenders but they didn't do what AmeriSave did. Their refinancing process was okay and it took four months for the application and underwriting. Their rep was very helpful and I had no complaints. I had a terrific experience overall. People wanting to go with AmeriSave should get a quote and they should check the reviews.,5
Louise,"Newark, DE","Reviewed March 1, 2018","AmeriSave contacted us about doing a refinance after we expressed interest online. Ryan, the rep we dealt with, was great and we'd give him a raise because of the way he represented the company. We did everything online which was very helpful and the application process was very easy. We used communication by email or by phone. It was awesome and we had our mortgage within six weeks. Their rates were also competitive with the other lenders. We’re comfortable with everything and we would tell others to look into Ryan as a person to deal with.",5
Sam,"Fredericksburg, VA","Reviewed March 1, 2018","AmeriSave had the lowest cost for closing, and the application was easy. We just submitted some applications and they did all the hard stuff.

Kimberli,"Mesa, AZ","Reviewed March 1, 2018","My husband told me to use AmeriSave and I did since I bought an investment property. But with my experience with them, I will never use them again. Instead of the underwriters telling me that this was what they all needed, every day it was something new that I had to give to them. They should have looked at my file and told me they needed these five items. And it wasn't me giving them these five items and then saying, they needed a follow-up to the five items that I gave them. It was a new item every single time. ",2
S.,"In, IN","Reviewed Feb. 28, 2018","We called AmeriSave and they made the process for our refinance easy. We liked their rates and lending credits too. We requested what documents were needed and the process didn’t take very much. We had a couple different officers and they were all very good. They were friendly and it was easy reaching out to them. I felt very comfortable working with them. The application and underwriting took them about 30 days. If they could have made the process in a shorter time, that would have been fine. A minor improvement would also be just knowing in advance what we needed for documents so we weren’t sending emails back and forth.",5
Wallace,"Decatur, AL","Reviewed Feb. 28, 2018","We wanted to get out of an LLC loan that was bumping up with the Federal Reserve every other month. AmeriSave is a direct lender and not a broker so we enrolled with them and all the people involved did an excellent job. They treated me professionally, courteously and the way it should be.

I have another house that I’m going to try to refinance and I’m going to ask them to do it.",5
Thomas,"Prescott Valley, AZ","Reviewed Feb. 27, 2018","AmeriSave was rapid to respond and I felt comfortable with the guy that I was talking with. He answered the questions that I had about the mortgage and what we needed to do because I was trying to get rid of the mortgage insurance since I've been in my house for 11 years. I had no problem paying my mortgage, but I was stuck with the stupid mortgage insurance. He was super knowledgeable and he was able to cut down a 15-year mortgage by 10 years.

I contacted someone and that person helped me upload a bunch of things through the web portal. That portal was actually very good. And then everything was fairly smooth. The web portal basically says upload the documents and then throughout the process they find that they needed other things and they call me or they send me an email and say that, “We need more stuff.” So I provided that. We were able to close right on target, within 30 days. It was a straightforward process. I spoke with the lending officer and the processor several times and both of them were excellent.

The fractions of points didn’t make that much of a difference in the overall loan I was looking for.",5
Henry,"Albuquerque, NM","Reviewed Feb. 25, 2018",I thought the interest rate of AmeriSave was good for my refinance. The loan officer I was working with was really nice and answered all my question although he was persistent afterwards. I availed of their 30-year conventional loan program. Initially had to agree to a certain extent that I wanted to go through with it and the loan officer wanted my Social Security Number so that he could obtain my credit rating history. That was a big step and I knew that even just doing that was a hard hit on my credit. ,5
John,"Ocean View, DE","Reviewed Feb. 25, 2018","I am on a 30-year fixed loan program with Amerisave Mortgage. I like that their rate was lower. The process of getting the loan was kind of lengthy and there was a lot of information I had to gather for them and give to them. And it took about a month all together. Some of their guys were helping me gather the information, and then when I was finished doing that and thought I've given them everything, they said they gave it to the underwriter and needed one more.

Srinivasa,"Concord, NC","Reviewed Feb. 25, 2018","I was looking into refinancing, and Amerisave had better rates and low closing costs. Another great thing about Amerisave is that they have an automated underwrite system that checks if you’re eligible for the total price, and I was through on that. So, there was no appraisal involved in the process, which went very well, especially since they have an online access to look at the application status clearly. I can also upload my files to their website, and then view the set if some other documents were reviewed or not. So, that was a great thing. Their representatives were also great. They responded very quickly, and they answered all of my questions in a very clear and timely manner.",5

They would call if they needed any other information or they'd send me e-mail to let me know of the progress of the whole mortgage. There was one rep that I worked with more than others, and he was great. If I ever had any questions, he would answer them and he handheld me through the whole process. It was not stressful at all.

Judy,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed Feb. 24, 2018","We have two houses that were on a variable and we figured it was time to investigate whether or not there was any value for us to do the refi. And we knew the interest rates were going up. Amerisave was the first one that called and the first one that we answered the questions to. Their online application process was excellent. If it had just been an online process, it probably would have been more difficult, but AmeriSave's people were there to talk us through each step, if we had what we needed, if we needed more, or if we had too much. The process involved gathering the paperwork that showed our financial status with taxes, homeownership, and salaries. And then with each one of those steps, the validity and thoroughness of the paperwork that we got information for were checked until we got to the point where we had everything and we were able to sign papers.

I happened to be out of town when he came and he misquoted when he said that I had a small area that had some damage to it. And they wanted me to get my plumber out to take a look at that. He said it was damage from the bathroom. That was a bit of a hassle and the process could have been sped up if I were home during the appraiser's visit. But other than that, it went rather well.",5

I got the interest rate I wanted as promised. They locked me on a rate when the rates were going up. They had 30 days to get it closed and they gave me an extension without costing me any more money. I got a 3.75% and it was great. The loan officer, once he got everything settled with me, as far as the rates and the information he needed on my side, he turned me over to another guy that I talked to.

I got the 30 year fixed loan and the process was just signing the paperwork and got the process started. It was streamlined, so there's no appraisal. I've given them verification of employment and then I waited until everything's settled out and then when everything was done, the closing was arranged.

David,"Bend, OR","Reviewed Feb. 18, 2018","I saw an ad for refinance and clicked on it. And then I started getting calls from every mortgage company around. They sent an email out and I responded to it. After talking to about three or four of them, the agent, Sean from AmeriSave, seemed genuine and generally interested in what was best for me and my family. It felt more personal with him than with the other companies that called. It wasn’t just business. We talked about different things too. But he actually misquoted what he could do for our rate and after I called the other mortgage agencies, they were all surprised with his rate. I checked back with Sean and he said he made a mistake and that he looked at as just a simple refi. But we needed a cash out option which raised our interest rate a little bit. But he was very upfront, honest and apologetic about the mistake. And I was able to still get a slightly better interest rate than the other mortgage companies. It was the best rate we can get.",5
Shaun,"Lewis Center, OH","Reviewed Feb. 18, 2018","I was looking into refinancing and I found quite a few good reviews online about AmeriSave Mortgage as well as some of the testimonials. They responded very quickly and it was very easy to do business with them. They did everything as well as they could. However, you have to be constantly looking at the web portal for the loan to process itself. Otherwise, you may not respond in a timely manner. If there’s a way that they could connect immediately via email when there’s an update, that would be helpful. Nonetheless, it was very comfortable working with them and I was happy with the rates I was given. In fact, I told a couple of people at work about them.",4
Eva,"Chester, VA","Reviewed Feb. 17, 2018","AmeriSave's reps were extremely on top of their game and our loan officer was great. They were following up every day by calling in or sending an email and made sure that we got it. They also made sure that we were staying on top of getting the information we needed to get back to them. But then, for some reason, I realized a couple of days after we signed all the documentation that they didn't get the information to do the autopay. We didn't sign anything and we didn't give account numbers. ",3
Isaac,"Reno, NV","Reviewed Feb. 17, 2018","Amerisave Mortgage was the first to call me and they called within minutes after I did some online thing. Nobody else called me within three days. I talked to a mortgage person and gave her my information then all the signing was done over the computer except for the final. They sent out a mortgage paperwork notary to the house, we sat down with her, and we did the signing within 45 minutes. Their application process is probably the easiest I've ever been involved in doing any house purchasing. It took about 3 weeks, including the underwriting. The whole process was stress-free and seamless, and I was able to do a refinance for 20 years with fixed rate.",5

I paid points for it but you pay what you have to. Their application process was simple. Corey and Jeremy kept me informed what was going on and every time I had questions, I called them. It would be nicer though if right upfront I knew everything that was needed because I sent one of the documents in and the website kept telling me that they needed it still even though Corey and Jeremy could see that they didn't need it.",5
Traci,"Norman, OK","Reviewed Feb. 16, 2018","I looked into a mortgage when we had a new home purchase. I went with Amerisave because of their interest rate -- it was the lowest I could get with them. I went with a 30 year FHA. In obtaining the mortgage, I just uploaded all the documents and followed up with the loan officer. Then it was transferred over to the loan processor and it was underwritten pretty quickly. The only hang up we had was that there was a documentation that was needed the week before closing after we were approved but that got cleared up within a few days. So, other than that, it was just an easy process. The whole process took a month, from January 8th to February 8th. ",5

The initial man that I spoke to that took all of my information was very patient and that started it off. He obtained all the necessary documents and that gentleman was just as professional and just as informative and patient and helpful. So whenever we came in to something where he wanted more information about something, it didn’t seem like an annoyance because he was so nice about asking for the information and helpful. It’s really about the personal relationship, and not about the company.",4
Christopher,"Washington, DC","Reviewed Feb. 16, 2018",I had a friend who used AmeriSave and recommended them. I refinanced with them because I got a better rate with them than my previously existing mortgage. I started in November time frame and then we finally closed on the second of February. Mine was probably more complicated than the average refinance ‘cause they had to check on a few things because of some other properties that I own. So I had to gather some information from them. I did all of it online.,4

The process took about three weeks, just the same thing you have to go through with every mortgage, but most of it was done online until we had to actually sign the paperwork with a notary and the notary came by here. Their reps answered all of our questions, mostly through email which I get in the evening because that’s when I’m home from work. However, their rate was a little higher than I’d hoped because it had gone up since then. Nonetheless, my experience with AmeriSave has been fine.",5

I had to do the original application and send them documentation that they requested. They sent me disclosures which had to be done and they notified me when they requested other documentation from me. I met with the appraiser and got the reports. ",4
Chad,"Houston, TX","Reviewed Feb. 15, 2018","When I went to LendingTree, they gave me several choices. I liked the rates that I saw with AmeriSave and went for their 10-year fixed loan program.

My only issue was the title company didn’t do a very good deep search and I had to do my own legwork. They pulled up old records of whose names were on the title, which weren't correct. Other than that, I'd recommend AmeriSave.",5

Then they send me an email where I have to put the agreement and I feel secure through their website. ",5

Customer service is very good and they are responsive to email and also the telephone. The staff are very polite, knowledgeable, and are very comfortable wot work with.

It was very easy for me to get the mortgage, it only took 14 days. Michael was one of the best and I’ve done several mortgages in my life.

Rosalina,"Lakewood Ranch, FL","Reviewed Feb. 13, 2018","From the beginning, Amerisave was very accommodating and very helpful as we were looking at options on where to get the mortgage. My mother-in-law, I think, has her mortgage through them. And she also lives on the same area where I got my house. So she’s like, “Try Amerisave.” And after speaking to Jeremy or Jacob from Amerisave, we didn’t look any further for another mortgage company. We only work with Jeremy and Jacob, and they were very, very prompt on their response. They walked us through the process and followed up with us when they’re supposed to until to the last day when the day we’re closing to see if we needed anything else. Every day we talk and email them. They alerted us in what document that we need to submit and extra documents for the compliance requirements. They really worked hard. ",5

The online application process was very simple but it was long. I had two pieces of property and one was a secondary home, so it was a little more difficult to get everything settled with that. But I was happy as long as the interest rates stayed what they originally told me, and they kept it there. My reps were Teresa and David, and they were fantastic. Teresa did really good work, but both of them were great. It was like talking to family. And they would call right back. The only thing I didn’t like was how much I had to pay for closing costs.

They had my files, so I keep it the same. Their online application process was very transparent. Everything was up-to-date and there were no back and forth questions. It was clear and displayed on the screen so I knew exactly what I needed to submit and when I needed to submit it. Everything was processed through uploading the documents. So, the whole transaction was smooth and easy.",5
Huan,"Spring, TX","Reviewed Jan. 26, 2018","I bought a new home and needed mortgage. I used AmeriSave before and I got a conventional loan from them. The rate in terms of the mortgage is fair. The price is good. I like the online application process very much. I recommended it to my realtor, so he could use AmeriSave. I just got online, talked to their processor, then they checked my credit score. I then uploaded all the files, and sent them. I got approved within eight days, so it’s really quick. Customer service was excellent, too. When you send emails, they respond within five minutes. The processor, officer, estimator, and underwriter are very fast. Everything went smooth.",5
Timothy,"Hurst, TX","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2018",AmeriSave Mortgage returned my call first and I liked the way the rep handled herself. Plus the rate worked out for me. Everybody was fine and the process went well. They did me right and I'd tell others to give them a call.,5
T.,"Ca, CA","Reviewed Jan. 25, 2018","I was refinancing and Amerisave were the first ones to call me. I talked to Aaron and he seemed pretty nice and knowledgeable so I decided to go with them. I got a fixed program for 25 years and it was a pretty quick process and everything was done online. I talked to Amerisave during the loan process, emailed them, they emailed me back. Everything seemed to go pretty well, so I’m happy with them. My rep was quick, prompt, and knowledgeable and the terms of my mortgage was fair.",5
Angela,"Albuquerque, NM","Reviewed Jan. 24, 2018","For health reasons, I had to relocate to the West Coast and that meant leaving an apartment and buying a house for the first time.

Chris,"Willow Spring, NC","Reviewed Jan. 23, 2018","I had a couple of properties I wanted to refinance. I looked into LendingTree, and then AmeriSave was one of the first who called me. They had better rates. It was what I was looking to do.

Mara,"Henderson, NV","Reviewed Jan. 23, 2018","I used AmeriSave before when I did a refinance. It was a pretty smooth process and they had better rates. I used them again for a standard 25-year loan when I was buying a new house. I reached out to them and Rebecca, the rep I worked with before, came back. I explained to her what I needed and we went from there. It was easy to get the documents that was needed to them through their online application process. It was also easy to see what I was missing and keep track of what I needed to provide. I was originally going to be looking at a lower percentage, but the point to buy seemed extremely high at the time. So, I was surprised about how expensive the points were. But I probably wouldn't necessarily stick in this 25-year mortgage that long. ",5
Oleg,"Carlisle, MA","Reviewed Jan. 21, 2018","I needed to refinance and consolidate my loans. Amerisave Mortgage was pretty competitive in terms of rates and the closing cost was less. They had numerous options and you decide yourself how much you want to pay like if you want to pay a closing cost or go for a lower rate but more pay upfront or high rates and no closing cost. So, having multiple options is a good thing.",5
Corey,"Fayetteville, AR","Reviewed Jan. 21, 2018","From enrollment to approval, that took me a week with AmeriSave. I did it online and the site was pretty easy to use, straightforward and I just put in the information. A friend of mine went through them and I used them for my first home purchase too. I worked with Nathaniel and he did a really good job. He reached out several times and walked me through the process. But a couple of days ago, I received a notification that my loan was transferred from AmeriSave to another lender, Wells Fargo, and that seemed a little off to me. I haven’t even made my first house payment to AmeriSave. Other than that, I’m happy with my rate and terms. I got the best rate compared to a lot of other lenders.",4
J.,"Al, AL","Reviewed Jan. 21, 2018",Amerisave offered a reasonable interest rate and everything was created via online and then electronically. It was excellent.

Amerisave was wonderful and very efficient.,5
John,"Sacramento, CA","Reviewed Jan. 20, 2018","Allan from Amerisave was the first person to call me back after I did the LendingTree application. He did it within probably less than 10 minutes. First impression is very useful and that was what really started the positive process out - the confident voice at the other end saying what they've got and that they could beat what I've got. The quick call was great and Allan spent the next two days with me, making sure I had submitted all the required paperwork. He was very responsive. I didn't wait more than 15 minutes for an email response or phone call reply. If ever it might have been an hour but that was very good. He did a fantastic job.",5
Thomas,"Alton Bay, NH","Reviewed Jan. 20, 2018","I had a mortgage from Amerisave a year ago and I got an adjustable rate. I went to a lesser amount.

I got a 30-year mortgage and I dropped $100 a month in payments. The rate could be better maybe, but it is what it is. ",5
Patricia,"Plantation, FL","Reviewed Jan. 19, 2018","We were helping our son purchase a new home. The application process with Amerisave took about 30 days and I did it on the internet. We didn't care for the process, though. We went through certain procedures which I had to deal no matter what, and we weren’t satisfied on things that they needed to do to get the loan. We were a little disappointed all in all. The customer service team was very polite, though.",1
Carol,"La Mesa, CA","Reviewed Jan. 19, 2018",This is not my first studio and I’m a retired real estate agent so I understand the loan process. I’ve worked in escrow which is a part of the closing process so I recognize a company that does a good job. Amerisave's price structure was excellent and easy to understand. They were no hidden surprises. It took 30 days to process which is pretty stunning. What they said they were going to do is what they did and they did it in a better period of time than what they estimated. They under-promise and over-deliver.,5
Becky,"Canton, GA","Reviewed Jan. 19, 2018","We had gone through one of those sites where we had a bunch of responses. AmeriSave Mortgage was probably the one of the quickest to respond positively and was willing to work with us and ready to go. They also had some of the best pricing on things. Some of the others were more, “Well, we’re not sure how you’re going to appraise,” and we ended up appraising fine. The online process to refinance was great too. We were able to e-sign everything until the actual closing. They were great on email responses, so it was easy to do. The customer service reps were great as well. There were two different guys who were both very responsive, great about copying each other on the emails and taking care of things. They were very much on top of things, and very timely. If I have friends who are getting into refinancing or mortgage, I will definitely recommend the company to them.",5
Michael,"Minot, ND","Reviewed Jan. 18, 2018","I did debt consolidation and AmeriSave was easy to work with for the most part in obtaining a mortgage. Their online application process was all right and there were some paperwork. The terms were fine and the rate was decent. Compared to all the other comparable rates at the time, they were good. I always wish I could have gotten a little bit better but they were all phenomenal for the most part. The rate I had before was slightly lower than the rate that I refinanced for, but it was still worth it for me to switch over to do the debt consolidation. ",4
Erik,"Suisun City, CA","Reviewed Jan. 18, 2018","I wanted to lower my interest rate. However, the process of obtaining the mortgage with AmeriSave was a pain. They’re from Georgia and I’m in California so everything was done over the internet. They have so many different people calling me to deal with my stuff, and that really sucks. They were also confused and didn’t even know what they were doing. They were telling me one thing and it came down to a lot of little weird stuff, plus it took a while before we got somebody that’s like, “This person is going to be there for you for the rest of your refinance.” Also, in the middle of our mortgage, somebody went on vacation so nobody took care of anything. I had to wait till she comes back and nobody told us along the way that was happening, which they eventually did. The way they communicated might have improved the whole process.",3
Floyd,"Mesa, AZ","Reviewed Jan. 17, 2018","AmeriSave Mortgage offered the best interest rate and their process for a refinance was really easy. I did it all online and it was very convenient.

Bob,"San Marcos, CA","Reviewed Jan. 17, 2018","I looked through AmeriSave, LendingTree, Quicken Loans and Wells Fargo, and AmerSave was just as competitive and they were more persistent. I talked to them, they gave me a bid and I accepted. They sent me a list of the things that they needed for the loan, I forwarded them, they reviewed those and made modifications. About three times, they came back saying they now needed this and that. After that, I got everything approved for my 30-year fixed refi. It was a fairly simple process. With all the things I had to fill in, the online application process took about an hour. I worked with the loan consultant and then his processor. Both of them were excellent, quick to respond to phone calls and emails, and pleasant to deal with.",5
Edwin,"Hendersonville, NC","Reviewed Jan. 16, 2018","I checked rates online and I got contacted immediately by AmeriSave, so they were quicker than anyone else. Heather was our go-to person initially, and she was very good. The process wouldn’t have taken that long, but it took me a while. I talked to them over 90 days, but that was my timeframe, not theirs. It was all online and it was efficient. However, there was a lot of people in the mix, like with the verification of employment with my wife's company. Her boss kept track of the phone calls, and there were seven phone calls total for a verification of employment. He also said he spoke to at least four different people. It became ridiculous. But that was the only thing that aggravated me. I would recommend them for sure.",4
Cristina,"Concord, NC","Reviewed Jan. 16, 2018","I had a few different companies give me estimates and AmeriSave gave me the lowest rates with the best details. They came up as one of the better providers too. I got their 15-year conventional loan. I worked with Ryan and he did a great job. He was very responsive when I had questions, explained stuff to me, and told me what he needed. We had an initial call where he told me what the process would entail. It was mostly updates and letting me know afterwards. The whole online system was pretty easy. It let me know what the status was, what documents they needed and what documents they had for me. But I had a couple of issues uploading some documents so I sent them directly to Ryan and he took care of it. ",5

Richard,"Rockingham, NC","Reviewed Jan. 14, 2018","We looked at consolidating some debt and went with a traditional 15-year mortgage with AmeriSave. It was a refinance and their online application process was easy. Application and underwriting, from start to finish, took about less than three weeks. I started off with the initial guy with online filling out of forms, and another lady doing that a couple of days later. All interactions were positive and I was pleased with the rates, too. I got a reduction of about 1% in my mortgage rate. That worked out best for me. With AmeriSave, it was a pretty smooth and painless process. I didn’t really have to leave my house. I was able to do everything online and read stuff through email, fax, or text.",5

One of my friends had a good experience with Amerisave and pointed me to them. Obtaining the mortgage went well. The process was painless, so it was great. Filling everything out was simple. They also helped me go through it if I had any questions in regards to the application. Anytime that I needed any assistance, the loan officer was there. They called back when they were not available at that time. It has been a long time since we've done the refinance of our house and this is one of the ones that really went smoothly. My wife and I were very satisfied with the experience. It was pleasant for a company to give us a really good rate, and the customer service was excellent.",5
Jesse,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed Jan. 14, 2018","My brother-in-law had refinanced with AmeriSave Mortgage a couple times and they had the lowest rate. I went through their process, which was straightforward in my case, and I sent them all the docs and my father's docs since he is a co-signer. Everything moved forward from there. During the application process, the 30-day escrow ended up taking much of the whole time. Also, there were a couple of docs that we needed from the HOA that they were late in sending and held the process up. It wasn’t AmeriSave’s fault at all. They could have closed our application earlier if they have gotten those docs. Other than that, the process worked out fine for me. Both the loan officer and the processor were really great and I was generally impressed by how responsive they were. They were both very helpful and friendly in a genuine way. ",4

I spoke to three different people. Quicken Loans could get me a better rate, but talking with our loan originator at AmeriSave, he brought up a really good point. I'll end up paying well, the rate might be better, and my payment will be a little lower because I'm going to paying for an insurance policy that I really don't need.",5

Also, I don’t know if the interest rates are going to be attractive in 10 years so I wanted to go 30 years with a fixed rate. I filled out an email for AmeriSave on a Saturday morning and within 15 minutes, their rep called me and we were on the phone for about 30 minutes. I got all the qualification part out of the way and he said that he'll send me an email on Monday morning and also between the call and then. He also said that he'll call on Monday and he did. I had the papers that he needed because I had already done it back in August so I forwarded everything to him which made it quicker.

They don't use all the big slang terms that the banks and lawyers use. And there ain't no hidden punches. I applied on the web and then they called and I talked to several people.

I have a few investment properties and one of them had a mortgage insurance I was trying to get rid of. This last time I was trying to pull a little the money out. As far as banking, at the online portal where they can use log in, that’s quick. Everything is pretty smooth. Obtaining my mortgage was easy. The last time though, there was a little more back and forth, but I know that’s down to the process. They want to have a couple things there at the end and that’s normal. I worked with a rep few times now and he’s awesome. There was another guy and he was really helpful, too. As far as across the board, compared to other companies, Amerisave is great.

They would send out an email but then after a few minutes, they'd contact me just to give me some updates. They’re really good, professional and has concern with their clients. They did an outstanding job and the rates and terms of the mortgage was 110% better than what I had before.

I went through the whole application process, which took a while. Once I submitted it, I got an email from AmeriSave, guiding me through the next steps and telling me what I would need as far as documentation to upload to the site. That was important for me because I work, and I have a digital copy of everything. So, I wasn't having to run around and fax stuff, which takes a little bit of time. That would have been a pain.

This is the second time I'm doing refinancing and the last time I did it was frustrating for me. Every time I tried to do something on one moment, I tried to quit because the other company was asking for too much docs. So I was surprised when the guys from AmeriSave didn’t ask me for too much papers. Everything was on the computer and I didn’t submit the taxes and statements.

So, I went online and AmeriSave was the first one that called me. My very first question before I started the loan application was if the loan can all be started until after the three-year period or if the closing has to occur after the three-year period. I was told that closing had to occur after the three-year period but it was not the case.

They gave me a closing reimbursable of $870. They didn't need me to pay for an assessment 'cause they were fine with it. The loan amount was small compared to the value, and that made the cost of converting a small premium. ",5

They proposed a rate and what the monthly payment would be. I’ve been through a number of mortgage refi's and home purchases before. It’s always after you do the initial lock in, there’s so much paperwork that they want. They want this faxed over to them, they want that emailed over to them, and all these documents.

Then, after that, somebody contacted me and we discussed various options and what I was looking for and why. He eventually proceeded to open up an application. The application and underwriting process took around 45 days, and everything was done the right way. Everybody was eager, on top of everything, and had the information that I needed. They have been responsive too. ",5
Kaditam,"Simi Valley, CA","Reviewed Jan. 4, 2018","Getting a mortgage with AmeriSave was internet and e-mail-based. We talked on the phone a little bit as well but it was all remote. I went to their website, put in some information to get some quotes, and then someone contacted me. And then once we got a house, we were able to give all the information through e-mail and their website. Their website was secure and seemed okay. It showed the status of each piece of information like whether it was reviewed or not so it was useful. They got the process done within 17 days. And it was timely since it was a short close. I gave the information when they asked for it. And usually, within 24 to 36 hours, they processed everything well. I was worrying about it, too, but everything came out efficient. The rate and terms were straightforward. They gave me the options and I knew what I was getting. Working with AmeriSave was easy overall.",5
Eric,"Denver, CO","Reviewed Jan. 4, 2018","I did a refi with AmeriSave Mortgage. I did a LendingTree thing and AmeriSave was the first one that answered and it was late at night. It was a super-easy and straightforward refi. The customer service rep that I had was awesome. She was on top of everything. She didn’t let anything fall through the cracks and she sent me reminders about paperwork that was missing. The application and the underwriting process was super-simple, and that’s really why I didn’t do any other shopping because I thought that it was that easy. My experience was good. They did a ton of their process electronically, which was nice. I probably had 40 emails from them during the process, so communication was great. We did the signing at our house with their agent.",5

He followed up on directing me through any specific questions I didn't understand, or any documents that I might not have understood as far as how to get them and how we could help to get the information that he needed. He offered his suggestions or input when I wasn't sure on the length of the term to proceed with.",5
Gautam,"Ashburn, VA","Reviewed Jan. 3, 2018",We chose to do our refinancing with AmeriSave primarily because of their rates. I called the online agent and from there on we went to the filling the doc requirements and then closing the process. It went very smoothly. The application and underwriting process took 30 days. There was a glitch. The application had limitation that's beyond control and their rep had to work with the IT department to get that fixed. But they are very professional in the whole process. They're very good and competitive.,5
Frank,"Slidell, LA","Reviewed Jan. 2, 2018","I was purchasing a house then. I researched and I had two coworkers that had used AmeriSave Mortgage and were pretty happy with them so I went with them. Being a first time home buyer, their process was good. Everything went smoothly and everything was easily available on the customer portal, which was good. Every once in a while, there was a little bit of a very small disconnect between the underwriters and the agents I was dealing with, but if there were issues, the agent got it cleared up really quick, so I’m very happy with the agents. I like that their agents would call me right away whenever anything changed, or if there was any information I needed to know. Also, I was able to call their office directly and talk to them during regular business hours, and if I left a message, they would call me first thing in the morning if it was after-hours. So their reps were definitely good on the communication side. ",5

I, however, didn't get my checks to pay my stuff on time, so I have late fee charges. Now, I got a thing stating that I need to have a payment in by January 1st, but I just got it yesterday. The application process was also a long paper trail and it was a headache. It took about a month as they kept on requesting some more. I was like, ""I gave you all those stuff already, but I guess it wasn't good enough.""

Sharon has been the agent that I have gotten in touch from the very beginning because she’s the one who’s assigned to my area. John and Matthew are the ones who have been helping me this last time.

Neil,"Miami, FL","Reviewed Jan. 1, 2018","I have been looking at reviews on mortgage companies in comparison sites like ConsumerAffairs, and picked out a shortlist of four companies. I then started speaking more in depth, and AmeriSave seemed to be the most honest, and they also had the best rates. Never having done a mortgage before, the process went smoother than we expected. We reached out, and AmeriSave people came back to us and they were very helpful at every step. They let us know, then we gave them what we needed, and then we got the mortgage. The guys from AmeriSave that we were dealing with were very attentive and were always happy to pick up the phone and explain things to us. They taught us a lot about the processes we were going through. We were very comfortable working with Leon, our loan officer. He handled it exactly the way I would want it to be handled.",5
Susan,"Chino Hills, CA","Reviewed Dec. 31, 2017","The process that I had to go through to get approved with AmeriSave was awesome.

My appraisal was waived and I was really happy with the whole process. The rate and terms were very fair. I said upfront that I did not want to pay any point. So, the rep told me, ""Okay without any points, this is the best I can do,"" and I was pleased. I'm constantly telling people it's so easy. They should go through AmeriSave. Good job, AmeriSave!",5

Once we settled on the terms and such, it was very quick. It took under under two weeks at that point. The only thing I didn’t like was that they handed me off to different reps a couple of times. Within a week, I went through three people, and then finished with the last guy over the last two weeks or so. But they were pretty good about getting back to me. I’d call and leave a voicemail, and I’d get a call back within half hour to an hour.",5

Marsena,"Mobile, AL","Reviewed Dec. 29, 2017","I refinanced my home without the second mortgage. Amerisave came and said, ""Well, you'd be better off if we do your home, and your second mortgage."" They calculated in advance, accounting for the escrow that I already had in the bank I was refinancing with, so they made enough money available at that point in time that they could pay the escrow themselves and I would collect later on. I liked that part where they advised me. Getting approved was a little confusing at times and I wasn't quite sure about what to do next as it was not really obvious. There was lack of print and sometimes they had been so small that I just don't see them. At a point I wasn't sure what was going to happen next and what to do next, the girls, and also the rep, were good. I could always call them and they'd give me the straight answer. I kept going in, and I eventually did the right thing and figured it out. Other than that, it was fairly easy. I was very pleased with it",5

They helped and were easy to work with. There were documents I had to sign and I didn’t have physical papers, so they would email them to me as an attachment, I would print them out, sign the paper, and since I don’t actually have a fax machine on my computer, I have an application on my cellphone that can take a snapshot of every document, turn it into a pdf file, and email it that way. It was easy and quick. And the few times that I talked to the rep, he was nice and efficient. ",5

Jordan kept me up to date and everything was right the way he said it was going to be. It was a great experience. Everything went well and it was a smooth process.

But I didn't want to continue this process again with another company. Also, the money was wired to my checking account but I had to pay a wire fee, which is a little weird.

The online application was fine, but something was confusing there when you submit it. I thought when I submit it, it can give you better clarification if I did everything well. Apparently, I didn’t do it and I didn't get the rate I could have got the day before, so I had to do it again the next day. But the process was quick and it was a 30-day close.

The AmeriSave rep told me what I was going to expect and see and how to get on with the borrower's portal, and I did that.

Vanessa,"Guyton, GA","Reviewed Dec. 20, 2017","I liked the presentation that I got from Clark, AmeriSave's rep. He explained to me the different kinds of programs I was looking through and gave me a lot of information that I couldn’t get from other places. I did the application over the internet and their process worked for me. I already owned the home, so I was just refinancing for equity that was mine, and I paid off the loan that I had prior. It was easy and the total application and underwriting process took three weeks. The only little niche I had was at the end, when it was time for them to give me the check, the company didn’t have the check from the lawyer that came to my house that Saturday, so I had to wait for an extra day. That process should’ve been a little bit more better expedited. The lawyer didn’t do his part as fast as he should've and told me it was because it was a holiday. It was around Thanksgiving. But I applied on November 6 and by November 30, I received the check.",5

The reason I went with Amerisave was the guy I worked with, Russell, was awesome. It took a load off my chest working with him. If I ever do a refinance in the future and he's still with the company, I won't work with anyone but him. He worked very hard. I called him one day while he was on vacation and he still picked up the phone. ",5

Todd,"Westland, MI","Reviewed Dec. 20, 2017",I was getting ready to retire and I want to put everything together so I went to AmeriSave Mortgage for consolidation. The biggest thing for me is that they were the first company who got back to me. Then they took care of everything right from the beginning. The rep took the information down.

I had to get a power of attorney as part of the process of obtaining the mortgage which helped me get the loan acquired. She still had to sign all the documents which she was able to do, but it took a little bit longer. After doing my part, I went to LendingTree and put in the information.

He did a wonderful job, did what he said he'd do and followed up on things. He really tried to get things going. But I was very disappointed and it was not necessarily his fault. I asked if AmeriSave would be the lender of my loan and the way we had the conversation, I understood that my lender would be AmeriSave. In my last two refinance, it was with loanDepot and I stayed with them because they financed the loan and stayed with the loan. I just don't like to be thrown around between lenders. I liked dealing with loanDepot and I assumed that this was going to be the case when Andrew stressed that AmeriSave financed their own loans. ",2
Todd,"Indianapolis, IN","Reviewed Dec. 19, 2017","I was generally thrilled with the whole process at AmeriSave and that’s the way to build a business process using technology that still has to deal with people, and they did a great job of it. They laid everything out quickly whereas the others were less than upfront on their cost. Also, everything was done online. That process was extremely easy to do, uploading documents and downloading their documents. And the time we met face to face was with the appraiser and then the closing officer from the title company. She came to our house and we did it in our kitchen table, so it was very customer friendly. Communication was great too. There were about three different people that we dealt with depending on the phase that we were in and they were all readily available by phone or e-mail, kept me abreast of where we were every step of the way. Generally, our experience with them was good, they were easy to work with, and I'd definitely recommend them.",5

I'm pretty happy with AmeriSave because I keep going back. This was the third time I've used them. I use the same loan officer every time and he does an excellent job for me. AmeriSave is really good with their customers. They stay in good communication and let you know what was happening. They get things done.,5

Applying online was very easy too and the rate was the best I received from any of the other companies that I was looking at. It was very quick and I was satisfied from start to end. It took five weeks to finalize, and then it went within two weeks from the time I said, ""Go ahead with this"", until I closed.",5

Gary,"Dayton, OH","Reviewed Dec. 17, 2017","I got a new mortgage from Amerisave. There was some competition with my own bank that I’ve been with for 25 years at least. I had two criteria for options: one is interest rate that I found acceptable, and, number two, a top-rated company. So, I looked online for the top 10, and Amerisave was there. It was close to probably within the top five. And then it came down to interest rate and my bank couldn’t get where I wanted to be. I didn’t want to pay down the interest rate to get too low. I was happy with 3.5, but my bank could only go 3.75. And they couldn’t go up or down like Amerisave could. You could go up or down based on how much money you put down. I don’t know how long I’m going to be in the house so I didn’t want to get stuck in a Catch-22. I’m moving four years, I got a better interest rate but I lost so much money, so it was time to make any difference. ",4

Amerisave had a few reviews that were saying they didn't get their credit so I was concerned about that. And I didn't have a problem with it. Amerisave gave us the best rate out of everyone. Quicken Loans was the first one I called and they ended up being the most expensive out of everyone we talked to. Also, all the banks wanted me to write a timeline with details of every single thing in my past history. And Amerisave just looked at everything and said, “Oh, yeah you guys are good.” It was just really easy.",5

I liked that when I called, I could talk to them. The application process was pretty much routine. I went over the rates and then the thing that was different about it, from any time I've done this before, was the uploading of the documents which was fairly easy. I worked with a gentleman at first and then once I started with the paperwork process, I then worked with Nikki and she was very helpful.

He asked me the questions regarding my income and my credit. He showed me how I could put in what I though my credit was anywhere from excellent, good, fair, poor, and then look at the difference options and what rates I could have. It didn't leave any surprises for me which I liked. We went through all of that and I completed all the paperwork online and they took it from there.

Elias,"Raleigh, NC","Reviewed Dec. 16, 2017","A couple of my friends were using AmeriSave and I signed up because of their experiences.

Then they needed to do an appraisal and the whole process took almost a month. I also had an almost high interest rate and AmeriSave changed the terms. I'm pretty satisfied with them compared with the big bank. If I go to Wells Fargo, it’s going to be a long process and I'll have all kinds of issues. But with AmeriSave, it's better.

I compared different mortgage providers for the mortgage that I wanted, which was a 15-year fix. I figured out which company would give me the best rates as well as the lowest overall cost in addition to the good rate. Ultimately, that all rolled into the best APR. I also looked which company gave the best personal service. It was a requirement for me that the people I spoke to were easy to get along with. After comparing several different companies, including Mr. Cooper, who had taken over my mortgage only a few months prior, and Quicken, AmeriSave had the combination of the rate that I wanted, the low cost, and the good people who could handle the process very efficiently.

I'm very pleased and I'd recommend them.",5
M.,"Va, VA","Reviewed Dec. 9, 2017",I was purchasing a home and I have used AmeriSave in the past. I did an online application and the mortgage process was quick and easy.

AmeriSave Mortgage isn’t some kind of a phishing scheme and they are superior to most of the other ones that I checked.,5
Prabhaker,"Atlanta, GA","Reviewed Dec. 8, 2017",I refinanced with Amerisave and they are great. I liked their general online process plus their interest rate was very good compared to other banks. Everything was loaded online and everything was easy. Nothing was a surprise. I talked with Charles and he was very responsive. He was able to explain everything. I loved it. They relayed e-mails and responded very quickly. Condos take longer times to refinance but everything went pretty fast.,5
Richard,"Grand Blanc, MI","Reviewed Dec. 8, 2017","I was looking to refinance with AmeriSave Mortgage to lower my payment. I found out at Lending Tree that AmeriSave had the best offer.

Rexanne,"Raleigh, NC","Reviewed Dec. 8, 2017","I was trying to pay for my daughter's college education so I thought of getting a mortgage. Since I used AmeriSave Mortgage the last time, I called them. Their application process was easy to do because we've done it before. It was nice because it didn't have to do a lot of going somewhere and sign in. It was mostly all done online. It was time-consuming though because we had so many pages that we had to initial but it was a lot easier to do in my own home. Adam, their rep treated me very, very nicely. I love him and this was the second time I dealt with him. He helped me walked right through the process and stayed on the phone with me. My experience with Amerisave Mortgage was wonderful and their rate was the best I could get at that time.",5
M.,"Mn, MN","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2017","In obtaining my mortgage, I started with the bank that holds the paper and got a quote from them. Then I reached out to an online group funding where I put my information in. I talked to about five people and Amerisave was the one who consistently had the best to offer so I followed up with them. The loan officer that I spoke with was very knowledgeable, helpful, responsive, understood what I needed to know, and got me the information I needed.",4
Connie,"Covington, GA","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2017","Amerisave was willing to give us a better offer. We did a mortgage refinance with them because we have very good credit and I didn’t want to do the PMI. I applied online and their website was very easy to navigate. The application process went smooth and we got approved in 15 minutes. Jordan, their rep, seemed like he wanted to help us the best way that he could. He was honest and gave me options and told us what wouldn't work for us. And I can send him information from another mortgage company and he will let me know if it's good or bad without going with them. If I'd take out any mortgage or re-fi again, I would definitely go back to them. AmeriSave would work with anybody. They try to help people, and if they can't, they can guide them with information. AmeriSave did very well and we had a wonderful experience.",5
Matthew,"Greenville, IL","Reviewed Dec. 7, 2017","I was looking for a VA loan and Amerisave came up through Lending Tree. They had the best rate and terms. The process was all online but it required me to send in a fair amount of documentation, scanning in a lot of stuff. Because it was a VA loan, the government was involved that was why there was more than there would have been otherwise. Whenever I submitted forms online, it got confusing. They could use some better instructions. Sometimes it seemed like they were wanting things more than once. They didn’t follow up a list of things that they needed, even though I had already sent some things in. I sent some things more than once to make sure that they had it.",5

This was my second time doing business with them and would not hesitate to recommend a friend or family.,5
James,"Thornton, CO","Reviewed Dec. 6, 2017","Amerisave lived up beyond my expectation. I shopped around and they seemed to be professional. And the gentleman I spoke with was very confident in what they will be able to do for me. Amerisave's process of doing a mortgage was completely easy. We started on a Sunday and in two weeks on a Friday, we were done. We didn't have to worry about doing any inspection. And our credit was very good so it was not an issue. Amerisave's online application process was fast and everybody should be doing that. Also, the customer service at Amerisave called me on a regular basis while on the loan process. They were very courteous and they seemed to be caring. They knew our situation which wasn’t a complicated one but what I was trying to accomplish was different than what most people want to accomplish. And so, they understood that and they were able to work with me to get every item on my checklist completed.",5
John,"Eddyville, KY","Reviewed Dec. 6, 2017","I was looking to refinance to get some additional funds. Of all the people that I spoke with, Laura from Amerisave was very helpful and very patient. I felt like she was a person that I could trust to go through the process. I liked the way she approached everything. Others would not return calls and Laura made me feel like I was someone important. She was very responsible and very knowledgeable, and all those things sort of added up to my decision to go with Amerisave. The online application process was very easy. Laura instructed me on what I needed to do next. It didn’t take long for the appraisal to happen. And then after that, we had the closing. It went very smoothly compared to other mortgages I’ve taken out. And based on other quotes that I got, Amerisave's rate was competitive. I was very pleased with Amerisave and I would recommend them.",5

Kimball,"Woodbridge, VA","Reviewed Nov. 30, 2017","I have had 10 different mortgages over the years, and HAVE NEVER had such a bad experience as with Amerisave customer service. We had hail damage to our roof last year, and had the roof replaced. Three payments were required to the Roofing company: our deductible, the first half of the rest, and a final payment of about $5k. Fine. We paid our deductible, and got a countersignature from Amerisave, which took a month. I got the check from State Farm for the final payment 4 months ago. I tried to send it to Amerisave for countersignature. No. They wanted a lean waiver, which had to be notarized, stating that all monies due had been paid. Fine. ",1

They have my mortgage in such a mess, the county courthouse has no idea on what they have done. Andrew the person I was last working with, his voice mailbox states full, the recording say press zero for more help. Good luck with that, it doesn't work either. I really believe this company is a scam, maybe not a scam as much as do not care about you or how they handle your loan. They surely do not care about you after getting your mortgage.",1

Benjamin,"Acworth, GA","Reviewed May 23, 2017","I had a lot of hesitancy in deciding to use AmeriSave because of all the older negative reviews. But their rates were consistently the lowest so I decided to go with it despite the hesitancy. The loan originator (Cindy) and processor (Ian) were extremely helpful and if I couldn't get a hold of them right away, they called back in a timely fashion. While there were some frustrating things that happened during the refinance, none of it was because of AmeriSave. They worked with me from start to finish and I couldn't be happier with the result. I will definitely consider them in the future.",5

No pressure, just information as I needed it. Chrystal ** was helpful and very forthcoming with pertinent information for me. She answers her phone when it rings. That's amazing.

We are very surprised to read how happy most of the customers are with Amerisave service. We experienced was just the opposite. We had an inexperienced, we think loan officer. He lead us to believe that we would get approved up to two weeks before the closing date. We didn't hear from Ray ** for over a week and the next time we heard from him he was telling us that it didn't look good for us. We think that a lender should be able to tell you if you qualify before they take you through this process just to tell you, ""You're not qualified."" We realized we had some credit challenges and we told Ray ** this up front. If the loan company knew this upfront why take you through this horrific experience. We are very upset with this company and we recommend this company to anyone.",1

Right off the bat, I gave him the restrictions I was working with and right away he sent me deals that were appropriate for what I was looking for. What made it even more simple was the fact that everything was visible to me. Many lenders in the industry try to hide things from you and according to them will give you the best deal, but only provide you the best deal when they are pressured by the fact that a competitor has outperformed them.

They are not pushy, and they really do take the time to explain things in a professional manner but they take the time to make sure I understand the documents that I am signing and why it is important. I believe I walk away knowing more about my home, loan and what benefits I have gained.

Almost 4 months and $700 later they turned us down on 11/7/2016. It was one botch after another from the initial pre-approval until the final turn down. They are inept, incompetent, and have the poorest communication skills (don't answer calls and only return them hours later). The whole time, our 'loan officers, Rob and Kelly, kept leading us along as if everything was going to be fine. They were counting my retirement as collateral only to turn around two and a half months into the process and realized they couldn't count it since it was locked in and untouchable until I retire (you would think they would know that).

If I listed all the horrific details I would exceed the 50,000 max character limit, so I will keep this short. First and foremost. if there was a way provide a negative rating, I would give them a -5 star rating.

Danu,"Metuchen, NJ","Reviewed May 23, 2016",This is by the far the WORST lender I have ever dealt with. My husband and I were in the process of buying our 3rd home (1st time using AMERISAVE) both previous times we went with Wells Fargo and everything was smooth. We both have very good credit and were putting down 20% for the loan and getting a 15% year Fixed Loan. Our townhome was appraised by one of their authorized appraisers and it got appraised more than the asking price. AMERISAVE locked us in with a great interest rate. That was the only good news we had from them. Everything turned downhill from the time our application went into the underwriter. ,1
Jennifer,"Toledo, OH","Reviewed May 18, 2016","I was in the process of completing a mortgage refinance loan, working with Chris **. I was pleased with the way everything was going at first, then the process started to slow down so I decided to look further into the reviews for Amerisave. What I started to see was that the original reviews I read that made me decide to use Amerisave were all from customers who weren't yet through the process. This is because they (Amerisave) will start out very aggressively trying to get all the documentation and the appraisal scheduled and during this time they send you e-mails asking you to review your experience. Since things go smoothly in the beginning, all the reviews are largely positive.",1
Kenneth,"Woodland Hills, CA","Reviewed May 11, 2016","We have just completed refinancing our second home with Amerisave. The long and tedious process was fraught with issues, some of which I have listed below. Please note that items in quotes were taken directly from emails received. We realize some of these items may be the result of state or federal rules while others might be company protocol. However, some of these issues are clearly the result of poorly educated and/or poorly trained personnel. Perhaps Amerisave should address these in order to improve the process for other customers.",2
lang,"Comstockpark, MI","Reviewed May 3, 2016","I had bad experience with Amerisave Mortgage about refinancing, I could not trust them. Begin with agreement closing fee was 1800$ and company will credit back 500$. During processing they want to increased closing fee about 4000$ by asked me to sign the difference disclosure pack, but did not discuss with me about that fee increase. I found out by do the math of detail of transaction. That is Ameriunsave instead Amerisave.",N/A
Tom,"Fort Mill, SC","Reviewed April 30, 2016","I love the online interface--the complete spectrum of quoting options allowed me to consider all different types of mortgage with detailed costs and make my own comparison and choice. Regular brokers only know and offer whatever people want most of and quoting alternatives seems to be a hassle for them. After starting the process, having all my documents submitted and viewable online, with a detailed status tracker, is tremendously useful and keeps me from emailing the broker or originator every day as I have with other companies. The people I've worked with, originator and processor, have both been very easy to reach, happy to help, and couldn't be better to work with on the few occasions I've needed to speak with someone directly. I'm just clearing conditional approval now but I think Amerisave is just terrific so far and would be the first mortgage company I'd use twice.",5
Pam,"Suwanee, GA","Reviewed April 27, 2016","We refinanced two loans with Amerisave. They had the best rates and stood behind their product. I loved being able to see my loan status online.

I expect that I will have to provide every piece of my financial picture from my bank account numbers, IDs, etc to finalize a mortgage. But I was shocked when they asked for all of it for the pre-approval with a deadline of the end of Sunday.",2
Keith,"Wolcottville, IN","Reviewed April 13, 2016",I will have to say that everything started ok. Brad was very helpful and seemed to be very attentive. Then once the appraisal was complete it all stopped. Days would go by without hearing a word. Then only after contact was made with Jeremy would we hear from Brad. Then we would be asked to send information that had already been sent sometimes 2 or 3 times. Then it went to title and much of the information had not been passed on to them and again we are asked to send information. Then a week goes by with no contact or replies to emails or phone calls. Then when we say that we are very frustrated and ready to pull out then and only then does Brad make contact in a way that was very rude and unprofessional. ,1

He answered all of the questions I had at the start of the process. My loan officer, Joe, was just as helpful.

Chrissandra,"Rogers, AR","Reviewed Nov. 25, 2015","I like Amerisave and refinanced with them many times because you can look up on their chart to see their current interest rate corresponding with the amount and how long you want to pay. You can choose your closing cost and interest cost. Even though sometimes having interest being really low can be great, high closing cost can cause you to have higher payments causing you to take a longer time period than you might want or if you refinance often for other large purchases, large closing cost is not always to your advantage. No other banks ever give you that option. They are also great answering when you need help.",5

She claimed that my bank listed the wrong payoff amount. That in fact, it was almost $2400 higher than the payoff I had received in the mail!

When I made the decision to buy a home, a friend recommended Amerisave, and needless to say, I am pleased with my decision. The rates were unbeatable and the customer service went beyond my expectations. Applying for a mortgage can be a stressful thing, and I had someone with Amerisave with me the entire way.

Malik,"Alpharetta, GA","Reviewed Aug. 13, 2015",This is my 3rd time refinance with AmeriSave. The whole transaction going very smooth and hassle free. Their web page design is very simple and anyone can upload required docs from your computer. Rates and closing cost also very good as compared to other mortgage company. One thing I like about AmeriSave is they are straightforward. Once you get GFE it's almost same during closing time so you don't see any surprises.,5

The problem came when trying to get an appraisal scheduled. In this small community it can be difficult to get an appraiser to take a request from a provider they are not familiar with. Unfortunately the folks I worked with were not able to get an appraiser to accept the job. I had to change to a different mortgage broker. The problem has been in the follow-up. I paid Amerisave to contract out the appraisal, and they never returned the funds. ",1

We have been trying to do a simple refi for five months now - we have good credit and make plenty of money. We have had to upload documents over and over and over to Amerisave - one person says they received them only to have the next day they can't be found. They required us to pay a huge fee for an appraisal only to now say we are declined for debt to income ratio?? They knew our debt to income ratio from day one! It never changed!

The ability to see the daily rates and associated costs is very nice, particularly when trying to compare rates. Easy to use interface to upload refi document. I have worked with Minka and Allison and both have been helpful. The only con is the speed with which one can complete the process. As such, if you are in a hurry, I would not recommend Amerisave.

Roch,"Portland, OR","Reviewed June 29, 2015",Amerisave is slow in processing your paperwork. They have now taken more than 100 days to process a simple refinance transaction without the ability to get the job done to this date. It should take 25-45 days. I am working with 1-3 mortgage refinances each year. This is by far the worst. Each week they ask for more documentation that is duplicate to the sources they already got. They do not ask for transcripts on time. They do not move the process along. It's like dealing with a team of amateurs. I would not be surprised if they used a lot of part time employees with very limited knowledge. If you want professional service use someone else.,1
Ray,"Grants, NM","Reviewed June 27, 2015","My loan officer was **, very courteous but completely wasted my time. My house is completely paid off and wanted to get some equity out it so I went for a Cash Out refinance. Even though I paid off my loan last year the underwriter wouldn't qualify for a new loan with my income so I was able to get my son's girlfriend who has great credit and makes good money, to co borrow.

Joe,"Carson, CA","Reviewed June 15, 2015","I got a call back from their representative in January and locked in what should have been a close at the beginning of February. Since then all I've heard are excuses about how they're backlogged and hiring people. They don't return calls or emails for weeks and my requests to talk to the supervisors have all gone unanswered. This will happen to you as well. They bring you in on a good rate, but if the rates go up, they will just keep asking for the same paperwork over and over that you've already provided. At least once a month they'll have you sit on the phone with some company in God only knows what country handing over your credit card information and details so they can verify this thing or that thing. They will never call you with a question - just leave a canned note on their website that asks for 5 things, but not the one they actually want.

Also I have closed but haven't gotten confirmation that we are done or that they have received the wired funds. Generally though all things considered I didn't have to work too hard for this and my wife was starting to wonder if it was a scam. ,4
Rob,"Houston, TX","Reviewed May 26, 2015","Amerisave had the absolute best rates available for my mortgage refi, and everyone that I worked with was very knowledgeable and helpful. However, they are very overloaded at the moment and closing times are greater than 2 months. To their credit they extended my rate lock without question or cost. All in all a good experience if you aren't in a hurry to get the best rates around!",4
Emily,"Greenville , KY","Reviewed May 25, 2015","Our lending officer must know how stressful the process of refi can be because she always responds to our emails/questions within an hour. Every time I've contacted them they've been professional and friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be able to provide this service to me. When my loan moved forward and was assigned a new processor, I was contacted by the new representative immediately just so he could introduce himself and assure us keep us posted.",5
Bernie,"Deerfield Beach , FL","Reviewed May 25, 2015",I'm in the process of refinancing my home mortgage. I am able to get the rate I wanted and will save hundreds every month.

Lars And Christie,"Raleigh, NC","Reviewed May 22, 2015","AmeriSave had the best rates of any lender we contacted, as well as the widest range of loans available. Their service was also excellent.

Ron,"Arlington, VA","Reviewed May 21, 2015","This is my second application for a mortgage with Amerisave. The first was a few years ago and went very smoothly. Based on that experience, I came back now that I have moved to a new house. Once again I am impressed by how easy the online process works to review options, lock a rate, and submit documents. I am also again happy that Amerisave combines the automation with personal contact via phone and email. The originator got right back to me, and a few days later I heard from the processor.",5

I'd definitely do business with Amerisave again!,5
Richard,"Brownsville, TX","Reviewed May 17, 2015","After applying to several mortgage companies and waiting at least three days for any response, I tried Amerisave.

Youssef,"Starkville, MS","Reviewed May 7, 2015",Great interest rates with low lending fees. The Loan Originator ** and the Loan Processor ** were very responsive and courteous.

I would highly recommend Amerisave for refinancing!!!,5
Robert,"Middlesboro, KY","Reviewed May 7, 2015",The process of refinancing through Amerisave was simple and clean. The rates and closing cost are outstanding.

Jon,"Exton, PA","Reviewed May 6, 2015","Loan application was January 15th and was pre-approved, locked and also approved through underwriting -- which finally occurred 50 days after application and took 20 days. I have supplied 114 documents so far (I do have a HELOC and a couple of rental properties also, so a couple extra are expected) and many of these multiple times. While I was approved with only 1 contingency (to supply one added HOA document), I have since received no less than 9 -- that is correct, NINE -- additional requests for NEW documents that make me realize that Amerisave has no actual intent on going to closing. IT IS CLEAR THAT SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO EXTEND THE RATE LOCK AS PROMISED (all due to their delays) since rates have since went up and they will lose money.",1
Holly,"Hatfield, AR","Reviewed May 6, 2015","I had been approached by another company to refinance and all the reviews were very negative. After a little research, I contacted Amerisave as their reputation was extremely positive. I am very impressed with this company. Their website provides many options for interest rates and terms that spell everything out up front. When I asked for a call, no sooner had I submitted my inquiry than someone was calling me. My loan originator was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all of my questions. I also appreciated being able to submit all of my documentation to them electronically and the continual updates on where I am in the loan process. Overall, I am very impressed with this company and am glad I chose to refinance with them.",5
Steven,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed May 5, 2015",Amerisave has been a great company to deal with both for my home as well as a few Investment property loans. ** has been involved with me now for three loans. ** has come aboard on this last one and also done a terrific job.

Rocky,"Marceline, MO","Reviewed May 5, 2015",These guys at Amerisave are the big leagues! Don't get discouraged of the process just because it's all done online and through the telephone.

Kelley,"Raleigh, NC","Reviewed May 4, 2015","** was the sole reason I decided to go with Amerisave. He was kind and patient, answering all my questions with respect. He never pushed me or made me feel pressured or rushed. He answered all questions I had and returned emails and phone calls promptly. He has kept me abreast of every step of the process. I have not finished the loan process yet, but everything seems to be going along well. My favorite thing is the loan status checklist. It explains every step of the process and shows you when each step has been fulfilled. For rookies like me, it helps me to understand the process.",5
Jeff,"Camarillo, CA","Reviewed May 3, 2015","To date the experience has been good. The loan officer was fair and knowledgeable. The online process has worked efficiently. The process, rates and costs were clearly explained. Response to my questions were answered timely by phone and email.",4
Mike,"Bend, OR","Reviewed May 2, 2015","The Loan Originator and Processor have taken all time necessary to listen to my needs and help me understand the basics and nuances of mortgage financing.

The closing has been delayed beyond the lock period, but Amerisave will extend the lock at no additional expense.",4
M,"Palm Springs, CA","Reviewed May 1, 2015",My mortgage banker is very responsive--calls back quickly and answers my questions with details. I had an idea of what kind of mortgage I would qualify for but I was a little off the mark.....my banker worked with me to find a way to qualify for the house that I want and was able to get me pre-approved.,5
Lori,"Antioch, CA","Reviewed May 1, 2015","From the beginning I sensed this company was different. I like how their rates, points and fees are clearly explained so one knows exactly what the transaction will be. Since my original inquiry, Originator ** has stayed in contact and was always available for any inquiry. **, Loan Processor, is showing the same commitment to delivering great customer service. I am severely ""technologically challenged,"" but have managed to handle this paperless process with the help of Amerisave staff. As a customer I often hear companies talk about making customer service a priority, but this is truly one of the first companies I have encountered making that commitment a reality. My inquiries are answered within hours, not days. I am just a middle-aged gal refinancing her little house, but -- and I kid you not -- I feel like I am getting the royal treatment. I am truly impressed by my experience with Amerisave. ",5

Melissa,"Saint Augustine, FL","Reviewed April 29, 2015","I generally don't take the time to leave such thorough reviews as I lead a very busy life, however, I think it's pertinent that I share my feedback and experience with Amerisave so that future prospects can read an honest review from a very satisfied client/borrower.

I applied for a simple refinance on a home over 80 days ago. The loan has an LTV of 44%, I have high credit and high income with w2's. Very simple to close but these incompetent processors and underwriters ask for things that are mind blowing. They are so back logged that the loan has been in process for over 80 days and still not closed. Now they ask for copies of my check to the IRS that has not been cashed. I would not recommend them to my worst enemy.",1

Literally within one minute after applying I received a very courteous call by a Loan Originator who took me by the hand during the entire process until closing. My refi was then assigned to a single Loan Processor who worked with me during the entire time and kept me well informed via email and phone of all requirements and the different facets of the process.",5

Our loan officer and loan processor are great and have been in constant communication for the entire process. Our refinance experience has been long. This is due to the overwhelming demand for mortgages and Amerisave has had a backlog of loans. But our rate lock has been extended with no cost multiple times.

Let me tell you, in this day and age, it is very concerning to get contacted by someone that has an ax to grind over your review and who also has access to your most sensitive financial information.

The company seems to be inundated with loan applications and quite behind. You can also check on the website about your loan status which is the most convenient feature of this company. The loan originator and processor have been very pleasant and responsive to all my questions and concerns. I've been assured of zero closing costs and fees but will reserve comment until the application is complete. The process has been easy going thus far!",5

Every time I try to finance through them I get a decline. Although another vendor gets me financed. They seem to have very good rates and I figured why not give them another chance. This had to have been the worst experience I have ever had with a lender. I have been working on this loan for over 60 days. Several times over the loan process the loan agent and the processor stop calling or answering my emails. I requested to speak to a manager and no one returned my call. So then I emailed the manager and the Senior Vice President and neither returned my call. After several tries I finally got a hold of the manager for the processor only to find out the processor was no longer with the company. ,N/A

I know I will get this back in a couple of weeks but that isn't the point. Also, Global Notary seemed to have been confused in their administrative responsibilities and caused me concern and consternation by telling the notary that came to my house, that they (Global Hq.) did not receive certain signed documents. I just think the process would have gone faster had I had the opportunity to select my own local title company. Due to time constraints, I reluctantly went with Linear Title. I cannot recommend them due to the above error.",5
Desiree,"Redbank, NJ","Reviewed Jan. 6, 2015","They have a slogan that says ""Instant, Accurate, Simple"", they failed on all three. Accurate? The loan originator tended to let his mouth get ahead of his brain. He sold me the loan in part by telling me that I would get a credit that would cover the closing costs and I would get any remaining amount of the credit after closing costs were covered. Later I had to point out to him that their own paperwork stated that under no circumstances will the borrower get any excess cash from the credit. Then he apologized for the mistake. Also he tended to exaggerate when referring to low interest rates and large credits. The actual numbers were never as good as he made you think they would be. The paperwork had inaccurate figures. For example the figure for the current loan amount on my property was double what it should have been. I was told it was a mistake created by the system and fixing it would cause things to have to be done over again. There were other figures that were incorrect maybe as a result of the lean amount being incorrect. Instead of him fixing the numbers I went through the whole process having to repeatedly see these incorrect figures and it really put me on edge. After all refinancing a mortgage is all about numbers and you don't expect them to be incorrect. ",2

I like how easy it was to contact them and how responsive they were. I also liked the transparency of the loan process and the ability to see and manage the documents that needed to be uploaded and when they were approved/finalized. My biggest complaint is the outdated nature of the disclosure process.

Elizabeth,"Waxhaw, NC","Reviewed Dec. 16, 2014","After having damage to our roof, our home insurance granted money for the repairs. We received the check and were made to give it to Amerisave, our mortgage company instead of being able to pay the roofing company. They keep saying they don't have all of the information they need to be able to get our money back (ex: missing pages 1 and 2) even though this has been sent via certified mail TWICE, emailed (with email address verification multiple times) FOUR times, and faxed TWICE (even though only one was required). They just want to hold on to the money as long as possible in order to make money. I understand it but they are using shady practices to accomplish it. I have asked for them to send something to me - email, etc. to verify receipt, but they refuse because then they have no more reason to hold on to the money. Complete scam artists.",N/A

That, besides being able to secure the best rate available by approximately 3/4 of a percentage point, is what really got my business. I wouldn't say that ""service"" per se is terrific as most of the work done in compiling and creating the needed reports regarding my finances was done by me, the consumer. But, their point of sale representative was outstanding and walked me through the entire process. Then, what really impressed me was the scheduling, completion and receiving of an in-depth home appraisal report in less than a week! Their methodology is really what sets them apart. Once my reports were uploaded, action was taken immediately. They are just the best, overall, that I've ever seen. Best value, quick, complete and thorough; how can it get better than that?",5

After 40 years of credit ratings in the excellent range the underwriter says my I didn't have a long enough history and too much credit card debt. The credit card numbers were know within 1 week of the application. At one point they were going to deny it because an addition on my house didn't have a permit from decades ago. It took 6 weeks to get the denial that could have been done in a week. My loan was for less than 70% of the appraisal value which would have dropped the payment $100 a month.

He addressed my concerns and helped me locked in a great rate that can't be beat else. Amerisave's rate lock process is very transparent and efficient. It took the anxiety away. I could see what I was getting instantly. My loan processor Lynette ** is extremely efficient and responsive. I was under the stress to close the loan before an overseas trip. Sean, Lynette and myself, we work as a team to facilitate the whole process. Lynette processed my case in the most efficient manner. She encouraged me when she thought I was doing a good job providing all the documents. I can't thank her enough that she made the process so painless for me, and we get to close at a record-breaking time -- only 15 days between when I first submit the application online to the scheduled close. I myself is a financial professional. From my experience with Amerisave and it's people, I see a greatly-run firm with bright future.",5

I know a company can never make everyone happy. However, today I closed a jumbo refinance within 60 days with hands down the best terms I could find anywhere. Multiple mortgage companies just plain admitted they could not touch the deal Amerisave was providing. Amerisave has the best documentation/status portals and workflow of any mortgage company I have used before. Going from initial application to lock within 15 minutes with an easy interface to upload documentation.

One thing I didn't like is that the underwriter questions were out of the scope of the loan. In this case you can speak directly to him/her and there is a time delay in conveying the answer, which ultimately leads to delay in closing. Other than this, I would go with Amerisave in a heartbeat with my home financing. The online interface is excellent as well as it gives the borrower updates on what is needed, what is required, what is the next step and the officer and processor are always available to explain.

Shannon ,"Shamokin, PA","Reviewed July 10, 2014","I've refinanced two houses with Amerisave. Both times I took advantage of their negative points system to refinance for free. I read a bunch of reviews first and was skeptical based on the negative ones. I've been pleased both times and if you have access to a computer (which you should if you're reading this) it's easy. Pick your loan and upload all the documents they ask for in a timely manner. I was honest, professional, and both went like clockwork. 1st refi closed in about a month, the 2nd one was delayed a few weeks due to some miscommunication. I expressed some discontent about the delay and they extended my rate lock free of charge, no questions asked. I really don't have a bad thing to say about either experience. Both times i significantly reduced my mortgage just by making a few calls and uploading some documents from my computer. The closing company even comes to your house to complete the settlement paperwork. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.",5

Around a month into the process (6/24/14) and after much cost and time spent and opportunities lost, loan was denied since apparently Amerisave does not fund properties rented on a temporary basis.

David,"Sorrento, FL","Reviewed June 26, 2014","After dealing with over half a dozen lenders, including the company servicing my current mortgage, I was blown away by the no-nonsense approach at Amerisave. Based on the business practices of most lenders, it is difficult to believe at first that Amerisave offers exactly what is shown on their website. Perhaps the best outcome of this practice: when you do need to speak to a loan officer, you can talk about real circumstances that affect your own situation, and get results much faster. Oh, and Amerisave also had the best prices.",5

Branton,"Corona, CA","Reviewed June 23, 2014","I contacted 5 lenders and then interviewed 3 of them extensively before settling on AmeriSave on a Saturday. Andrew was very patient, helpful and responsive to emails and phone calls throughout the weekend, even when he was not in the office. Rates and selection were excellent and this was the only site I found that was offering a 10-year fixed ARM. There was a website issue and even though Andrew tried, we were unable to lock my rate or order an appraisal over the weekend. So he committed to honoring the rate on Monday and to arrange for scheduling the appraisal then. One thing I really liked was that Andrew said everything is done just out of their one office in Atlanta and that he would be my contact person during the loan approval and even after should any issues come up and those tend to do so with any loan over time. That means no foreign, anonymous customer service call centers. That, along with the great rates and Andrew's customer service pretty much sealed the deal for me. ",5

Every summer, by the time the payment voucher would reach me, I was already late making the payment and fell into the grace period.

Diana,"Marietta, GA","Reviewed May 21, 2014","On 5/2/14 (3 weeks ago), I started the loan application process with AmeriSave after comparing their estimated closing costs and being able to provide the particular type of loan I was seeking. I made it CRYSTAL CLEAR with Andrew, the loan officer, that I wanted to ONLY refinance my first mortgage (currently $61,000 balance). I reiterated MULTIPLE times that I did not want to TOUCH the HELOC (currently at $99,700 of $100,000 limit). I explained that that loan was made up entirely of my estranged husband's debt and that would be a big hot mess to fold those loans in together. I said if AmeriSave WAS willing to subordinate with Wells Fargo I liked their package and wanted to proceed. It should have been a red flag that they charge a $9.20 credit app right upfront....a little ""gravy"" even if the loan goes nowhere. Then the appraisal has to be pre-paid before they come out. That gave me pause, but I knew my credit was stellar so they had no reason to decline on that basis.",1

Troy,"Lakeville, MN","Reviewed April 1, 2014","I've used Amerisave for three refinances. They are one of the lowest priced of the internet based lenders. Much less than a traditional bank based lender. The key to success is to scan in your documents before starting the loan (Last two months statements of all accounts, drivers license, Last two years tax returns, W2's, last two paystubs). Be responsive (fast) during underwriting to requests for information. Don't transfer money around between accounts or deposit money from unusual sources prior to the application. If you've got access to a scanner, their web based application system is really easy to use. I appreciate their participation in the Mortgage Professors ""Certified Network Lender"" program which makes comparing their rates to other companies easy and transparent. My two Originators are Neal ** and Michael **.",5

It seemed as though Ms. ** made every attempt to make me feel as though I would not be qualified for the loan which added a tremendous amount of stress to the purchase process although prior to the file being submitted to her it had long been pre-approved.

Many other mortgage companies I tried told me it couldn't be done because of the number of mortgages I already had (5) or debt to income was too high but Jeramie ** from Amerisave said my application looked fine and between him and Randy ** we closed in 30 days even with tenant and appraisal problems. The current mortgage is moving swiftly along thanks to Jeramie as he even moved most of my documents from my 1st loan to new one saving a lot of time.

S.,"Seattle, WA","Reviewed Feb. 10, 2014","AmeriSave had the lowest rates when compared to other leading lenders. I was pleased with their service rep and suggested speed of closure. There was an additional charge in the closing costs that wasn't initially reported and that was for a ""document review"". Their final numbers aren't provided to you until you actually pay for a credit check ($14) and an appraisal which could be ($625). The final numbers were close to the original - higher but still lower than other lenders.",5

Reginald,"Florissant, MO","Reviewed Jan. 31, 2014","The experience overall was good. However, the processor's communication could be more proactive to minimize miscommunication and delayed timing in the closing. I never discussed bringing funds to my closing event for a re-fi. However, it was brought to my attention a few days prior to closing that I was required to bring outside funds to closing. This was never discussed during my application and I personally feel that it could have been avoided if the AmeriSave Processor's communication was better. As a result, I was inconvenienced and my closing was re-scheduled several days later. Outside of this experience, all others activities went well.",3

Frances ,"Leavenworth, WA","Reviewed Jan. 21, 2014","With one caveat being that we have not yet closed on our secondary residence condominium refinance, our experience has been positive thus far (11 days in). Our CFP recommended this company but warned us we would be doing the work. After we figured out how to convert our computer printer to a scanner and actually located our documents, the process was time-consuming but easy - and easier than actually visiting a bank/etc. Our last financing experiences took place in the deep dark days post-economic meltdown and I put this task off for a full year in dread. Amerisave has seemed to work out issues they may have had in the past, and for the absolutely not-understandable requests, we have an assigned human being to intrepret. ",5
Anil,"Mckinney, TX","Reviewed Jan. 21, 2014",This is my second mortgage with Amerisave. First I like the fact that you get the rate and closing cost comparison without giving your personal details online and having to deal with sales calls.

Although I was a little disappointed that I couldn't do the refi I was wanting due to the appraisal (No fault of Amerisave, It's the economy). Casey did come up with a refi that saved me close to $170.00 per month and cut several months off of my mtg. Amerisave has a fantastic system. I loved being able to download and upload all docs including the signed ones. Yes there is a lot of paperwork. But in light of the mortgage bubble burst it's good to see Mtg Companies dot their ""I's"" and cross their ""T's"" so to speak. I would use them again.

Don,"Sandy, UT","Reviewed Nov. 15, 2013","I'm 80 1/2 now and I hate being jerked around and not being able to get the ""sales person"" off the phone. One Great thing about Amerisave is that you can pick your own rate and length of loan. The second Great thing is that when you have included all the costs from Their ""View loan"" pages, they NEVER come up with additional 'costs' at the closing table. My experience with Amerisave has found them honest, fair and super helpful. Good Luck if you don't choose Amerisave.",5

A lot of detailed information is required, but it is after all, a mortgage application. My initial contact described the process to me and helped me (easily) to the next step. Clearing financial history was a little more difficult. One of the credit agencies had a revolving credit account in my name that I did not recognize, and we could not get an understanding of that entry, so I held up the process until that was cleared. My Amerisave contacts patiently helped me to collect more information regarding that account and armed with payment amount and dates, I discovered that it was a carpet purchase made on time payments that had been paid in full some years ago. To clean up accounts, I had the loan agency close the revolving account.",5

When I have worked with a traditional mortgage broker in the past the fees and closing costs are always kind of a mystery but with AmeriSave you know what you are paying.

My first 2 loan experiences, I was happy with as I mentioned in my first review. This last experience was bad. First of all, on the day of closing, Amerisave emailed me to tell me that the properties will need to be quitclaimed out of the trust. A last minute surprise. Early in the process, the title company they use asked me to confirm that there would be no change in property vesting; property was in the trust at that time. I confirmed no change. Secondly, the closing notary arrived late, had erroneous HUD statement on one of the loans, was quite disorganized. It took more than 4 hrs to complete the signing process. She did call before she arrived that she was in traffic, and I asked her what time she expected to arrive and she said she would still be on time. ",N/A

I should note that I recommended AmeriSave to a family member and his experience was a nightmare (3.5 months, misplaced documents, very poor closing coordination) even with having a very favorable debt to equity ratio and an 800 FICO score. I would use AmeriSave again... he most definitely would not.",5
Robert,"Pawtucket, RI","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2013","I was reluctant to use Amerisave for the refinance of my loan because the online reviews of this company were pretty bad.

In short, Michelle and Melissa, the two reps I dealt with during my loan process, were WAY BEYOND helpful and patient. They addressed all my concerns during the loan process. I thank them both. Finally we did the close signing in my house. The closing was done by Paul who was exceptional. Paul guided my wife and me through all the closing paperwork in a funny, personable, and professional manner. In a nutshell -THIS REFINANCE WAS EASY.

I just got busy and forgot about it. I compared the fees with another mortgage lender and my credit union. Amerisave fee was $2K lower based on the same interest rate. I really like the overall process of submitting all the documentation online. I didn't have to make copies and send them via USPS. The loan officer kept me informed on my loan application progress. My appraisal came in lower than I hoped. I had to come up with more money to close so I can keep the loan to value ratio at 80%. I didn't really have any issues with that as it further reduced my monthly payment. I'd recommend Amerisave to my friends.,5

Once loan processes started, the system was easy to upload financial documents, but it was not always clear if I needed to upload information. I had to make a few calls to my loan officer to ensure you had everything you needed to move forward. My loan officer was very helpful during this process. When rates fell during the loan process, AmeriSave did not automatically offer any adjustments - I asked for an adjustments. This would have wowed me. The closing went smooth as well.

Raymond,"Elburn, IL","Reviewed Sept. 19, 2013","I learned about AmeriSave through an internet search engine. I was looking for a low cost mortgage loan with an online application process. I filled out the initial quote on the AmeriSave site and received an offer of a low interest rate with very reasonable processing costs. I was contacted via email by an agent and they explained the application process. I submitted all the needed information by uploading it to a website database and when I had questions, they were promptly answered by my loan application agent. The review and approval process took about three weeks and I was provided updates at key points along the way. A representative of the company came to my home for the final signing of documents so the entire process occurred in my home and on the internet.

Also liked how they showed you where you were in the process. Having information is key and you could access that online and not have to try and get someone on the phone. There was an issue at closing the underwriters didn't get done in time so the closing was moved 3 days back which was fine with us. It was a short turn around in a busy season with Thanksgiving just before closing so that's why they missed the deadline. All in all, Amerisave was a great experience.",5

Apparently there was a problem with our appraisal and the type of home that I have. Because of this confusion, my first refinance fell through despite how positive my mortgage advisor was. What was so disappointing with process the first time around was the loan processor changed twice and was really difficult to get in touch with. A week after that horrible experience, I received a call from my mortgage advisor. He was also baffled why my refinance did not go through. He convinced me over the phone to do this once again and he is going to put his superior in the loop to keep the ball rolling.

Not only are their rates the best, but from the application to the closing, it couldn't have been any easier. Their website makes it very easy to know what's needed and upload all the required documents and a loan processor is just an email or phone call away. I highly recommend them.",5
Jon,"Golden, CO","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2013","Overall, I had a pretty good experience getting my loan with Amerisave. It's not for everyone, as you will have more responsibility gathering documents and really knowing exactly what you're trying to accomplish with your loan. It can be frustrating going back and forth getting them all of the information they require. For me, I knew what I wanted, and they had the best rate I could find. It took a long time to finally get the loan, but they extended the rate with no fee to me, and eventually I did get the loan and the rate I wanted.",4
Greg,"Henderson, NV","Reviewed Sept. 16, 2013",Fast response and very easy. I have done several loans in person that were not as easy.,5
Stephen,"Saltillo, MS","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2013",Application process was too involved...too many hoops! Closing was uncomfortable since we had no representation.,3
William,"Murphys, CA","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2013","Overall, my experience with Amerisave was okay. The online user interface took some getting used to, but then it was easy enough. You will need a scanner and fax handy though. I felt that my mortgage processor could've been more informative, that would've helped. The closer, Jaime, was awesome, which made up for a lot. Overall, I give Amerisave 3 out of 5 stars.",3
Kurt,"Cottonwood, MN","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2013","My wife and I decided to look into refinancing the mortgage on our house in late February of 2013. After several contacts with Mortgage companies by phone and online, it became immediately obvious that Amerisave could provide the best rates. It also sounded like almost everything could done online. So we filled out the application and 4 weeks later we were closing on the loan. The closing was done in our home and that was the only part of the process that we were not able to do online or by phone. I am very happy with Amerisave and would recommend them to anyone considering a refinance. ",5
Klaus,"University Place, WA","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2013","We now have our 3rd mortgage through Amerisave since 2009, and soon will apply for the fourth. We saved thousands of dollars, and I don't feel that I had to do extra work to do so. Our experience with their appraisers was very positive. At the time of our latest application, we were not able to lock in right away. This made us quite anxious, as rates were very low. Yet, when we were finally able to lock, we got an even better rate!",5
Lindsay,"Happy Valley, OR","Reviewed Sept. 15, 2013",AmeriSave was an incredible company to work with. I not only saved a good deal of money but was treated with a high level of respect and professionalism throughout the entire process.

I would highly recommend AmeriSave!,5
Chris,"Bethesda, MD","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2013","Amerisave was easy to deal with and responsive. We switched processors halfway through the documentation process however, which caused a delay and almost caused me to miss my closing date. Other than that they were responsive. ",3
Lien-Huong,"San Jose, CA","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2013","The entire loan application experience was fantastic. The automated mortgage processing was fast, accurate and very efficient.

I also got excellent service from all loan agents with prompt, professional and courteous help with all questions. Amerisave Mortgage is definitely among the best loan financing brokers in the market!",5
Keith,"Trenton, MI","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2013","I've done at least 4 refinances in the past; but my most recent refinance loan through Amerisave was different from all the rest - way different - way better. Everything was done online - Everything - No Mail. Everything was quick - real quick. As long as I provided everything that was asked from me promptly which I did abide by. I applied on a Friday, and a guy was at my house Monday appraising it - Remarkable service, remarkable efficiency. Truly, I've never experienced anything like it in the past. Everything, I mean everything was fantastic, the efficiency, the speed,the fast responses, the lowest interest rates.

Benjamin,"Covington, LA","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2013","I have done 3 loans with Amerisave and would definitely do business with them again. The best thing about Amerisave is they offer great rates, give you tons of flexibility to customize the loan to fit your needs, and give you an upfront accurate estimate of what all of the costs will be with no surprises. My only gripes would be that it sometimes takes a while to get your mortgage processor on the phone and they don't have backups that can help you in the meantime. They are extremely thorough in the approval process and require to see the same information from several sources (ex. W2, payroll stubs, tax returns, etc.). Some of it seems like overkill and a nuisance but it may be like that everywhere post financial crisis. Overall, I've had a positive experience with them.",4

I knew that he did his homework before choosing AmeriSave, and after checking it out, I decided to go with AmeriSave as well. Great decision. The simplest way I can put it is that AmeriSave had the best rates, the lowest fees, and great customer service throughout. We moved through the process quickly and had everything ready to go well in advance of my closing date. Their website made it very easy to understand the process and for exchanging the necessary information. I am very pleased that I went with AmeriSave.

I have told my friends if they refinance to go to Amerisave. ",5

Dick,"Ossining, NY","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2013","Last fall, I refinanced two homes with Amerisave Mortgage. I was attracted to Amerisave because of their excellent rates but I also found their service and professionalism to be excellent. Both refinancing experiences went smoothly; in fact, the Amerisave staff worked extra hard to minimize the paperwork I needed to provide on the second home by duplicating my paperwork from the first home. The staff were responsive to my questions, explaining everything I needed to know in a prompt and clear way. They worked quickly and efficiently to keep the process moving forward and to make sure everything was completed by within my 30-day rate lock period so we could close the mortgage on time and without any problems.

Kyle,"Mooresville, NC","Reviewed Sept. 10, 2013","Amerisave offered a fast, hassle free quote. Banks and mortgage brokers want to haggle over closing cost which is annoying. Amerisave held true to the good faith estimate and was actually slightly lower. All the documents needed could be scanned and submitted online which was easy. Best part for me is the closing attorney comes to the house and I never had to leave the house for any part of the refinancing. The customer service is great if you have questions. I would definitely recommend Amerisave to anyone. They are by far cheaper and have better rates than banks or other mortgage companies.",5

Susan,"Colorado Springs, CO","Reviewed Sept. 9, 2013","Everything was organized and easy to follow. Some of the documents seemed a bit repetitive in requirements but overall a good experience.

Communication was excellent via both email and phone. Researched consumer complaints regarding Amerisave from a number of sources and reached the conclusion that if you have a realistic opinion of the value of your home and you can verify your ability to repay the loan, you will have no problem obtaining the advertised rate and closing on time.

The secure document upload feature is great for submitting sensitive financial information. I was promptly approved, subject to appraisal, and locked my rate. The appraisal was done the next day. The entire process went very quickly - with fees and charges exactly as quoted on the website. I set up auto pay with my bank and I get a monthly statement that clearly states principal and interest paid. I would not hesitate to recommend Amerisave.",5

The whole process start to finish from the time I locked in my rate went quickly and only too around three weeks. My loan processor and financial reviewers were quick to respond and processed all the documents I uploaded quickly. The loan was ready to close before the date we originally thought it could because Amerisave did the paperwork so fast. Everyone we worked with at Amerisave was courteous and professional. This is the second time I have used Amerisave for a mortgage. I recommend them and would use them again. Great job Amerisave!,5
Wendi,"Urbanna, VA","Reviewed Sept. 1, 2013","We had a very good experience with AmeriSave. Great service, prompt replies to questions, a second, better servicer assigned when our initial loan application reviewer noticed our first servicer was not matched right for us - we didn't even have to ask, best rate by far compared to any others at the time we were looking, and we were able to do our payments as an automatic debit.",5
Edward,"Bound Brook, NJ","Reviewed Sept. 1, 2013",We refinanced our house with Amerisave. It went great. Our rep Brad did everything he said he would. He even called me back on a Sunday to answer some questions. I have already recommended him to a friend.,5

Timothy,"Abingdon, VA","Reviewed Aug. 31, 2013","I started a refinance with Amerisave in December of 2012. After a few emails, we started getting down to business. Interest rates were the lowest I had ever seen for a home loan and we locked in the rate of 2.25% for 45 days. I refinanced the entire amount including closing cost. The closing agent came to my home and completed the closing in about an hour. Bottom Line is Amerisave delivered their promised rate in 34 days and I will save $191,000.00 over the life of the loan. I highly recommend a 15-year loan if at all possible and I highly recommend Amerisave. They did deliver to me as promised. Since then, my loan has been sold to JP Morgan Chase. They also have been excellent to deal with. Thanks to all those who helped from start to finish.",5

I was able to take advantage of the best rates that AmeriSave offers because I have always tried to keep my credit score as good as possible. The loan process was very thorough paperwork wise but was very understandable. There were a number of steps to be carried out to provide the loan team with the information but it was all listed out on a website and the items got checked off as they were completed. I got to choose the closing location at my lawyers office. My experience overall was very very positive.",5

I was updated on my status fully and had a closing in 3 weeks. The fastest I ever heard of. Clearly AmeriSave hires quality employees that go above and beyond in order to service their customers. The process is so easy and the Rates or Fees are below market. I can't see why anyone would not use them. I received a gift card for writing this review, regardless of whether my experience was positive or negative, but I would have written my review if I had not gotten anything.",5
Jim,"Broadview Hts, OH","Reviewed Aug. 29, 2013","Amerisave Mortgage did great walking us through all the aspects of the loan process.

Everett,"Lincrott, NJ","Reviewed Aug. 29, 2013","The process we went through to refinance our house was all via email and electronic uploads which was very convenient. That said, some of the documentation requested made no sense at all and required me to essentially perjure myself to complete the process. I got the impression that the mortgage ""counselors"" or whatever they were called were being force to act as form pushers and box checkers. If you can ignore the annoying parts, the rates were good enough to make it worth the hassle.",3
Anthony,"San Diego, CA","Reviewed Aug. 28, 2013","Incredibly easy process, attaching documents myself turned this into a 1 day process instead of weeks.

Doug,"Alexandria, VA","Reviewed Aug. 28, 2013","Overall experience front start to finish was not bad. Initially the response from my agents to my questions was slow and at times not answered. But as the deadline towards the closing approached, the responses were more timely. Some of the requirements for loan approval were so silly that it made no sense to me; but I chalked it up to an industry that has been in the spotlight for approving loans that should not have been approved, as well as to internal company turnover of agents working my application in the middle of the process, which added about an extra week of delay. All in all, though the experience was not bad considering it was all done online (except for the actual closing). There weren't really any surprises (fees and costs not initially declared) when it was all said and done. I would recommend them for your refinance needs.",4
Andrew,"Denver, CO","Reviewed Aug. 28, 2013",I thought overall that AmeriSave did a great job on my refi. The folks were very helpful and responded promptly to my questions and concerns.

Scott,"Houston, TX","Reviewed Aug. 28, 2013","My processors both helped me throughout the process. They provided detailed information that helped me make a decision about when to lock in a rate. When it came to crunch time before closing, I felt like I was the top priority. AmeriSave’s offer was also better than anyone else's. A mortgage broker tried to charge me $4K for the same loan AmeriSave paid me $1K to get through them.",5
Katherine,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed Aug. 28, 2013","AmeriSave has a very detailed system which is quick, easy and user friendly. Everything is spelled out so there are no questions unanswered.

Jerry,"Columbia Falls, MT","Reviewed Aug. 28, 2013","Our desire was to refinance at the lower interest rate that was available. Time was of the essence because the rates had bottomed out and were beginning to rise. We contacted the lender which held our current mortgage, and to our dismay with a 700+ credit rating, they said all we qualified for was a reverse mortgage. After trying a couple more companies without much success we were in touch with Amerisave, and they assured us that we could refinance through them, and at a lower rate than we had hoped for. I was amazed at the ease of the whole process. The Amerisave personnel we dealt with were pleasant and helpful, and guided us through the entire refinance in less than a month. Thanks Amerisave! My wife and I are more than satisfied with your work for us.",5
Annabelle,"Mooresville, NC","Reviewed Aug. 28, 2013","I have refinanced with AmeriSave 3 times now. My current rate is at 3.25% for a 30-year mortgage. The process was easy and stress free.

Eleyas,"Burnsville, MN","Reviewed Aug. 27, 2013",I am very much satisfied with the whole process. All the persons involved for the refinancing do know what they were doing.

I would highly recommend my friends to Amerisave and would ask them to specifically request if Amanda can work on their case. I found the best rate & cost at Amerisave compared to all the other quotes I received. I also like the Amerisave Automated Online System, the ability to get a quote and lock in your rate and the overall online experience.",5

This time it was only 21 days because this time around I had all info ready and faxed back almost immediately the info asked for. Closed with no problem as before with a 2.625 rate for 10 years. The one thing I liked best with Amerisave was when I called with a question if nobody was there someone called back within the hour.,5
Dayle,"Stockton, CA","Reviewed Aug. 27, 2013","This is my second refinance with Amerisave. I watched the rates and locked in my terms after watching their website daily. The process went smoothly, and my loan closed within 30 days. I have seen many negative comments about Amerisave. Before applying for a loan with Amerisave or anyone else, you should know your credit score and have a general idea of what your home is worth. Also, you need to be able to check your e-mail at least once every day and provide them with all of the documents they request. Make sure you have access to your tax returns, insurance policy, paycheck stubs, bank statements, and any other documents they ask you for. ",5

I must say that generally they follow through on their commitments, though they sometimes miss dates and deadlines. However, my last experience with them left me very dissatisfied, as they were late on everything, and after 45 days, swapped the loan from a 2nd home mortgage to an investment home mortgage, which caused my rate and closing costs to go up significantly. Their position was it was their policy based on the 2nd home proximity to my primary home that they had to consider it an investment home mortgage - my problem is that the homes did not pick up and move location from the 1st day of my application where the addresses were supplied.",2

They organized everything from application to loan rate lock to doc signing. Their website with rates are posted daily and everything is explained in detail.

I was able to upload all documents requested and do everything by email. My loan processor was always available by phone too, and I did use that on occasion. After much research, including local credit unions, I just couldn't pass up the great rates Amerisave offered, their quick service and their extremely low fees. ",5
Nikki,"Las Vegas, NV","Reviewed Aug. 22, 2013",My husband and I have refinanced with Amerisave twice and both times the experience has been nothing but positive. They are quick with replies and their interest rate and fees are better than most others with which we have compared.

They are quick to reply to our concerns and questions which resulted in our loan being finalized quickly. ,5

The only issue I had was the online processing system was not always quite as intuitive as I would like but again it was easy to get help and direction whenever there was a question or doubt on next steps.,5

Bryan,"Little Rock, AR","Reviewed Aug. 21, 2013","I refinanced my home late 2012, closing early 2013. My goal was to take advantage of the historic low rates and access a bit of equity for a kitchen remodel. I had only done home loans through large banks in the past but at the suggestion of a friend checked out some of the internet providers. I was drawn in by the excellent pricing but had some reservations having never gone down this path. I also read some bad reviews about Amerisave but decided to throw caution to the wind and go for it. I am pleased to say that all went very smoothly and was consistent with how it was presented by the company in the beginning. I have excellent credit, good income, net worth and home value so I would have been surprised at any glitches, although some of those complaining said the same thing. I was very pleased with my Amerisave experience and would readily use them again. It was very simple, pretty quick and saved me a ton of money. ",5

In the beginning things went well. A few documents were asked for several times as other people had mentioned; however, I kept a folder of everything that I submitted and it was easy to resubmit the requested information. Honestly, there was only two or three of these requests. The overall process was good. I got the rate that they quoted, got a refund check when the process was completed because they calculated some items too high - but better to get a refund than still owe! I would recommend Amerisave and use them again if the opportunity arose. However, I hate the lender that bought my mortgage from Amerisave!",5

I of course accomplished that shortly after closing by doing a quitclaim back into the Trust.,3

In just 18 days from making an offer, we have closed on our new home. I would highly recommend Amerisave based on the service I received from Kristina **.",5
Mike,"Colorado Springs, CO","Reviewed Aug. 21, 2013","We bought our home almost four years ago with what we thought then was a low interest rate. However, as rates continued to come down, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to refi for a lower payment, which has allowed us to pay extra principal each month. Our most recent refi with AmeriSave was the second since buying the house and probably our last. The AmeriSave online tools were extremely helpful with monitoring various interest rates and terms and then locking, once we found the best refi for us. After locking in our rate, the process was very transparent and simple to upload documents through the AmeriSave website. Our closing was scheduled at our house after work hours and went very smooth. I would recommend AmeriSave to anyone looking to refi their current mortgage. ",5

They were quick, responsive and I was always able to keep track of where we were in the process online. I especially liked that the final numbers were extremely close to the initial numbers I was quoted. I was doing comparison shopping with 2 other lenders and the first one couldn't come close to matching their rate and the second one said they could match everything, but when we started putting numbers down on paper, they were adding a bunch of closing costs that I wasn't having to pay for Amerisave. Probably the best thing I can say is I can't remember any negatives at all. There was no drama, no last minute surprises, nothing very memorable. I was able to do everything except the final paperwork signing easily and quickly so it didn't interfere with my work day. ",5

Every so often from then on, I would get an email from Grant telling me the rates at that time. As rates got lower in early 2013, I started looking for a loan and got a rate quote from one of your competitors and started working with them. Just as I was ready to commit to them, I got an email from Grant that seems better than what I was getting. I called him and things were put in motion. Things went fairly smoothly. Some documents were asked for twice which was disappointing but no great problem. Grant turned me over to a processor, Rene **, who was outstanding to work with. I could not have been happier about working with her. From my first contact with Grant to approval, it was three weeks and closed within 4 weeks of that same first contact.

This is the kind of service I expect (but don't really get) from the bank with whom I have a longer and deeper relationship, and I certainly didn't expect to get it from a heavily online operation like AmeriSave.

They didn't communicate with me during the process and I continually had to follow up on their work to help complete the loan (appraiser, payoff of my existing mortgage, etc). Ten days before my rate lock expired, they emailed me and said that my debt to income ratio was 1.2% higher than allowed (under reported my income for the loan) and I didn't qualify, even though they had my information for over a month and said everything was fine. I asked if I could pay the cost of a 1/8 lower rate on my loan and they said they would for $1,100. ",N/A

It's hard to gather one’s thoughts into a concise format while shakingly angry; same goes with my grammar skills, as well as spelling. As of now, all I can think of are words that probably would make Satan blush with embarrassment. First, we were supposed to close at a great interest rate. My financial advisor and I both asked him to confirm rate and closing cost. He tapdanced and finally told us to stop incessantly emailing him. My advisor washed her hands and said she would not work with a person that conducts himself in this manner. He said that he had told me the rate already, it was in the paperwork and he didn't need to confirm it. Well guess what? ",1
Mark,"Missoula, MT","Reviewed May 12, 2013","I applied for a refinance. I got all the paperwork, faxed it in the 48-hour limit. Credit score was 800+. I paid the $550 for the appraisal. Then I was rejected because the underwriters said my house was of a contemporary design and none of the other houses in the appraisal were of a contemporary design. They would not approve the loan, even though the appraisal came in $90,000 more than I was asking to borrow. The Amerisave agent responded that I would get the same result from any other lender. So what the agent is trying to tell me is that I would not be able to sell my house because no one would approve a loan for my house. The only thing contemporary about my house is the roof line is different from most other houses. I will try a local lender and see what they have to say.

After the appraisal was done and the fee was paid, Amerisave told them that the property zoning requires a variance to be rebuilt. This was not a property type that Amerisave can approve. Both our attorney and agent never heard such reason for disapproval. Since we bought our property 12 years ago, we never added any additions. Plus, we never had any problems with getting our mortgage nor refinances twice. Our agent called Township and was told Township would not give a hard time to give the variance for the undersized lot as long as the new house to be built is within the side yard setbacks and conforms to the other bulk requirements. Afterwards, my husband called Township. The zoning officer told him our property absolutely is not undersized based on this particular location, plus our property is not going to be rebuilt for 99.99% chance. Apparently, Amerisave underwriters didn't do a good job. Based on the above facts, anyone can tell this is very minimum risk. We urge the loan officer to call the Township to resolve the issue!",1

When I asked them if they could use the one we had just gotten done, they said it was fine except that the bank that we'd gotten it done through would need to give them the assignment letter for said appraisal, which apparently no one ever provides. So of course, this means that Amerisave refused to use a completely valid appraisal for an arbitrary reason just so they could get our money!

My credit score comes back 770-780 with the 3 reports and income of $200,000+, debt to income ratio of less than 20%. It should be a done deal, right? Wrong. Great service turns to slow response. Long story short, underwriter for Amerisave says they didn't like a decline in my income for a year when my company did $100,000 in IT upgrades, so my personal income was lower that year. The mortgage I was refinancing was $130,000 (payment was under $700 total), a drop in the bucket. Horrible service, slow to respond, and a waste of time.",1

I went to the Amerisave site and entered a bunch of information to get a rate quote, and the rate was considerably higher than what was advertised. I called Amerisave to inquire and the response was that they only post their lowest (sub $417k loan) rates on Bankrate. Since my loan was above that, the rates would be higher. I figured OK, that's fair I guess. The rate quote they're giving me is still competitive.",N/A

However, like many others on here, once I started the process, things came to a crawl. I provided everything asked for (promptly), had a 795 FICO score, and the process still took 120 days to close. The loan processor came back asking for the same information over and over, items I had sent in several times before. We finally finished the process but came close to pulling the plug in the middle due to the frustration experienced. They simply chalked it up to being very busy. I would not recommend this company to anyone, regardless of credit worthiness.

She appraised me much lower than 2 years ago. A friend with a Century 21 franchise told me house prices had held steady, not dropped. Still, I agreed to accept the Amerisave lower appraisal. Then, Amerisave told me their underwriter couldn't use their own appraiser’s appraisal. The underwriter said despite their own appraisal, he could only loan me half the value of their own appraisal.

Here, I'm warning anyone who is trying to buy a foreclosed or short sale property, stay away from Amerisave. We have waited for over 5 months for a short sale deal. Amerisave lured my husband with good interest rate, discounted closing cost, etc. At that time, I just felt there was no free meal in this world. Their offer sounded to be too good, but my husband insisted to do business with them. He believed it's our excellent credit score that earned us that good deal. The short sale is sold ""as is"" which is typical to most short sales. We can put 20% down payment. Also, we paid off our current residence.",1

Some of the pay-off money was coming through a cash-out on the mortgage and some of it from my own pocket.

Since we have more into the house than what it's currently worth, and to get a 3.5% rate, we said, ""What the heck? It's time to refinance."" Lo and behold! Their appraisal company assessed us and think they received $375.00 to appraise the home. Then, they said that we can only loan up to 80% LTV. In other words, the company is a scam. Stay away if they use these kinds of practices. Needless to say, thank God, it's a credit card charge and the deceptive, false charges will be contested with their false advertisements in hand.

Their website was easy to use, so I could see how our appraisal price would affect the loan-to-value ratio and most importantly, credits (cash back from the loan). I was told their rates were impossible from a lender I was working with, but in fact, they weren't and we saved about $160k on interest for the life of the loan which was nearly double what we would have saved with the next best offer.",5

Median means combined (Webster's), not combine the lower and leave off the higher. Amerisave used only the lower score. This is bogus and false advertising. They know if you don't take what they offer, you will have a credit inquiry that looks like you were turned down, which will lower your credit score even though you turned them down.

Paul,"Gaithersburg, MD","Reviewed Nov. 4, 2011","We had a recent and painful experience with Amerisave Mortgage. We found a good rate on a loan and closing costs were listed as $3000. We began the process of applying. We copied tax forms, pulled together statements and faxed everything. The process moved quickly! Within 2 days we had an appointment for the assessor to appraise the property and a title insurance contact. At the same time we were told we qualified for the loan and just needed to download the notices, disclaimers and consents from Amerisave.com. ",1

Joel,"Alameda, CA","Reviewed Oct. 19, 2011","One of the worse communication I ever had the nightmare of dealing with.  My credit score is 814!  I want to combine the loan taken for my kid's university and primary plus cash out for a total of $170,000.  I spent four hours on the phone trying to reach the agent, and another three hours at night on hold as they advertised a 24/7 service.  The recorded message kept saying that I will be connected in less than a minute for three hours in a row.  Then, I received an email saying that my mortgage has been canceled.  Do you think that I should ever proceed?",1
Patrick,"Tulsa, OK","Reviewed Oct. 5, 2011","After submitting 190 pages of supporting documentation, signing disclosures, and paying for an appraisal and credit report, I got a call today from Caz ** saying they've lost my information.  I was ready to lock today as we were 3 weeks into this process.  But now these guys tell me they've lost my personal information.  The lower rates don't compensate for the risk of having your personal information floating around because of a lack of quality control.  As a result of their lack of competence in protecting my information, I cancelled my application.  I can't see rewarding this kind of behavior.  I told my friends and clients about the lower rates offered by Amerisave.  But I will tell them it isn't worth the risk. ",1

Like other people on this site, Amerisave asked for every bit of information under the sun and we complied.  Then, they said that we did not qualify.  They made us pay for an overpriced appraisal, too, just like others on this site.  In retrospect, I am glad that they declined us so we won't have to deal with them.  Never again.",1

Zhen,"San Francisco, CA","Reviewed Sept. 20, 2011","I got a quote from Amerisave company that seems very attractive so I called them to find out.  They promised everything, sent me a package to fill out and sent it back right away.  Furthermore, they immediately scheduled me for an appraisal the next day.  The appraisal cost was almost $600, much higher than the peers.  Then, they let me wait and wait.  After two weeks, they started to complain about the house condition, the interior setting and how the furniture was set up.  Then, they notified me that the loan was declined due to my credit.  My God.  My average credit score was 798, my house value was over $800,000 and I only refinanced for $390,000.  It was ridiculous.  I think that this company was very irresponsible and unprofessional.  They meant to charge high appraisal; not for the loan.",1
Dan,"Los Angeles , CA","Reviewed Sept. 6, 2011","I just closed with Amerisave. I read a number of complaints against Amerisave and I understand the frustration that many of these writers feel.

Brian,"Deerfield, WI","Reviewed Sept. 2, 2011","On August 2nd, I locked on a 10-year ARM where the points were listed as ~400 and a rate of 3.875.

On August 26th, they finally fixed my GFE to reflect the 10-year ARM and gave me points of 1,700, probably based on what the points were for that date.  As a result, they padded their fees by $1,300.",2
Atul,"Frisco, TX","Reviewed Aug. 31, 2011","AmeriSave lied to me.  And they made a false promise in adjusting my locked-in rates for loan refinancing.  AmeriSave charged me $8 plus $375 on my credit card for the processing of my loan application.  The original quoted rates differ from what they were asking me to sign.  They forced me to roll in the closing cost of 10,000 dollars into the loan amount, despite the fact that I told them many times not to do that.  As per Annette's directions, I arranged for 10,000 dollars with my bank.  I got the funds ready for them.  ",1
Philippe,"San Francisco, CA","Reviewed Aug. 23, 2011","My wife and I have excellent credit; in the top 1%. We started a refinance of our primary residence with a particular rate in mind. Our loan to value ratio is about 35-40%, depending on the appraisal value, and we have sufficient assets to pay off our loan.

Paul,"River Forest, IL","Reviewed Aug. 20, 2011","Amerisave advertises broadly on the internet with rates that appear low.  However, their pattern is to look for openings to reduce the closing credit that they advertise, with artificial, non-industry standard definitions.  In our case, our closing credit was reduced by $3,000 because they redefined our refinance as a refinance with cash out.  We were informed of this after the appraisal costing $450 was made. ",1
John,"Vineland, NJ","Reviewed Aug. 19, 2011","Run, don't walk from Amerisave Mortgage.

Amerisave was contacted because they advertised loans at competitive rates with $1400 closing costs and $1000 lender credit, making it almost a zero-cost refinancing.

Here is what happened.",1
Alan,"Houghton, MI","Reviewed July 30, 2011","I was denied credit due to an unacceptable appraisal. Our appraisal had many errors and corrections, resulting in a denial by AmeriSave to accept the appraisal. The appraisal came in a little lower than expected. So our loan-to-value ratio rose from 68% to 72%, causing us to lose out on our rate lock and having to lock in a current higher rate (or the same rate with higher costs)! This was the only issue with valuation but not a deal breaker; however the original appraisal erroneously stated that the home was ""tenant occupied"" in addition to ""owner occupied"". This snowballed into a mess that caused several updated corrections (I have 8 different copies) from the appraiser followed by a denial by AmeriSave due to ""unacceptable property"" and ""unacceptable appraisal"".",1

I have to admit that if I read these first, I would've ran. I am glad I didn't. My experience was totally the opposite. Don spent a lot of time on the phone explaining the loan process with an online lender. He told me he couldn't lock me until full application was completed, my documents were faxed in and reviewed, and we may have to wait for the appraisal to be completed, unless I have a lot of equity.
