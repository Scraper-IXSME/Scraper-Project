Lois,"Salix, PA","Reviewed June 22, 2023","Kristen accurately, patiently and with great knowledge reviewed ALL my options in moving my assets into Gold and Silver. She helped me diversify my portfolio into gold and silver for both short term and long term asset management.

Lauri,"Portland, OR","Reviewed May 30, 2023","I had no experience or hard knowledge in dealing with precious metals. I only knew that I wanted to get away from the stock market and this was a viable solution with physical assets. Once I made the initial inquiry, Ron ** led me through the entire process in layman’s terms, made me feel comfortable, and was available anytime with any questions. Once the 401k transfer process was completed I was set up with Frank for purchasing my assets. This was where I was really inept. He could not tell me what to buy but guided me the best he was by law able to. ",5
Ami,"Hudson, FL","Reviewed May 12, 2023","Having been a successful traditional IRA investor for nearly 40 yrs, it was very difficult for me to consider rolling over my IRA into a money metals IRA; however, given the current declining trajectory of our global economic affairs, I wanted to explore this option to protect my assets. From the first day, Matt ** provided me with outstanding customer care in this decision-making process. Never once did I feel pressure. He was very patient, kind, friendly, informative, and professional with me throughout the process and was very knowledgeable in this regard. I genuinely felt that he had my personal interests at heart. And I appreciate knowing that I can continue to call him at any time with any questions or concerns I might have regarding my money metals IRA in the future. He has always returned my calls and made me feel like I was his only customer that day. Thank you Patriot Gold and Matt ** for putting my mind at ease.",5
Kenneth,"Defuniak Springs, FL","Reviewed Feb. 15, 2023","When I was in the market to buy gold, I did research on companies that had excellent ratings and found out that excellent ratings alone are not enough when deciding which company to go with, one of the issues I found with a couple of companies was that they offered upfront incentives, like free coins etc, but this turned out to be nothing more than a bait & switch, the coins they offered were restricted to a limited selection & after they add their markups the buyer is not really getting anything FREE!!!",5

Cheri,"Boise, ID","Reviewed Dec. 10, 2022","Up until 2020 we were flying high with our 401K's and other investments. We've both been retired for a few years. We saved, planned well (or so we thought) and we had more than enough to enjoy a comfortable retirement and to pass on assets to family. Then came this word salad of an economic policy and we were concerned. We've been gold owners for quite a long time, but had never considered a gold IRA. While investment growth is still preferred, for us now maintaining and protecting our wealth is most important. I did quite a bit of research online and felt that Patriot Gold Group was a good match for us. We worked with Mike ** and he was there during the whole process. The instructions on how to move funds from a 401K to Patriot were excellent and their back room was very efficient. In fact, the only stumbling blocks we experienced were in moving funds out of a federal employee 401K! (Imagine that!) We highly recommend!",5

Patriot Gold did not try to steer (manipulate) me. No hassles with Patriot Gold. Fair pricing. Quick shipping. I recommend Patriot Gold to others, and I will only buy from them.

No question was too small nor too redundant. Patriot Gold Group has stellar online reviews and rated one of the best companies to work with. Their offer for free storage fees is huge. Most competitive companies charge $200-$300 a year or more for metals storage. I had very little left after the market crash of 2008. Michael helped me cull various small IRA's and 401k's together into one portfolio. They did all the legwork for me making it not only easy but they also absorbed all the fees my current plans wanted to charge me to exit them. Nothing was too small for PGG to handle for me. ,5

James,"Charleston, WV","Reviewed Feb. 11, 2019","I had an annuity that was closing out. The interest got me and I needed to roll that over into something that I was hoping would be a bit more stable than the stock market is right now. I've read about metals where the market dropped in 2008 and the silver tripled and gold doubled. I figured since it was getting close and things were looking dire in the picture, that would be the way to go. I called Lear, but Patriot Gold offered me a no-fee IRA, which meant I didn't have to pay any fees, such as storage fees, which was excellent. When Lear sent me their brochure, there were a solid amount of fees that they had for their services, where Patriot Gold just right upfront let me know if they could give me a no-fee IRA. That was the deal breaker and it was just a no-brainer after that since Lear didn't even offer to me when they would talk to me. ",5

Patriot Gold did it quickly. In a day, they were able to roll the money over from Fidelity through the normal rollover process and then took less than a couple of weeks to initiate the whole account, so it saved a lot of time. Patriot took a good amount of time on their end to answer questions before I even started to think about rolling my money over. They had a person named Mike who took his time to explain to me over a few days certain questions that I had, like what type of coins, what is approved and what is not, how to do the process and the fees associated with each activation. Patriot Gold is operating very well and they are very clear on what they're doing. I and my wife are both are satisfied.",5
Choong Kun,"Honolulu, HI","Reviewed Feb. 4, 2019","When buying gold or silver, timing is important. The timing Patriot Gold recommended wasn’t that good and they could do better. I had to wait for almost one year to get the price I paid to be recovered. Another thing is that a monthly development of the market, at least through email, is advisable. Also, when we buy gold through Patriot, they should explain to the customer that they are willing to buy back anytime when the price is right, agreed upon by both parties type, not just the selling. That kind of arrangement has to be guaranteed or provided so that customers like me residing in Honolulu should be at ease in buying and selling, that when they go through Patriot, those guys will take care of all the details. On a different note, the guy, Andy, was very helpful. My compliments to him.",5

Mind you I spoke to about eight companies. Only three made it to a deal. My phone calls are returned or answered right away. Whomever I'm speaking with is always polite. I really just wanted a family because this is so long term, and I got that with Michael ** and the whole team. I understand that everyone needs to get paid in these industries but Patriot saved me 5 grand so that tells you about their pricing. I can't say this enough, 5 stars is not enough for Patriot. They're the best. Thanks Michael! Thanks Patriot!",5
James,"Fairfield, IA","Reviewed April 10, 2017","Be very aware of doing any business with the Patriot Gold Group. At first things seemed to be on the up and up but then matters really changed. I was working with Dan ** and typical of a salesperson he was forthcoming with information about gold and silver investing. So my first mistake was not getting what he told me in writing. When my(100K) funds became available to Patriot Gold he became very pushy and aggressive which are two things that I do not tolerate! Initially his company was going to take care of set up fees and administrative fees for 3 years for a precious metals IRA. However, when Dan called me and told me my order was ready now all the sudden I was having to pay for these fees. ",N/A
Larry,"New York City, NY","Reviewed March 24, 2017","I've bought gold for 20 years and have had many problems trusting companies. Failed promises, not returning phone calls, high pressure sales. This changed my whole outlook on gold companies. Since working with Bill ** I've reallocated my gold and silver to Patriot. I didn't have to do all the paperwork, Patriot's IRA department handled everything for me. This week we are bringing in a group of family investors. With so much tension in the world right now I just wanted a company that's transparent, Patriot is truly a family I can call and feel secure. I highly recommend over all companies, and I've invested with all of them. Thank you Patriot Gold Group.",5
Drew,"Santa Monica, CA","Reviewed Dec. 31, 2016","I contacted the Patriot Gold Group in July and started working with Andy **. I'd bought Gold and Silver in the past and never really been impressed with any of the brokers I'd worked with. None of them seemed to listen to what I wanted. They just wanted to get as much money as they could and get me off the phone. Andy suggested I do a small portfolio of Gold and Silver and see how things went. He knew I'd made much larger purchases in the past but suggested something more conservative to start. Since then I've been in touch with Andy on a regular basis, I've converted my IRA which is well into six figures and made several large cash purchases. I've shopped Patriot's prices but now I know I don't have to. Just like he said they are considerably lower than anything else I've found. I've not only found someone I trust but we've become friends.",5
Stacy,"Santa Monica, CA","Reviewed Dec. 30, 2016","I was looking into different firms and found Patriot Gold Group online. I called and spoke with Andy **. I have never purchased gold before so Andy thoroughly explained the process of gold buying, but never made me feel pressured, and made sure I understood the process before moving on. I was only calling to investigate the process, but I ended up converting my IRA, and making a sizable purchase of gold & silver to keep at home. That was back in July, and I hear from Andy ** any time there are good opportunities in the market and he is always available when I call with questions. I couldn't ask for a better experience and highly recommend Patriot Gold Group.",5
Curtis,"Citrus Heights, CA","Reviewed Dec. 21, 2016","I purchased $4k of gold from this company. Still to this day after months of hassle they have not returned my money. They claimed to have shipped the gold on four occasions, never any gold shipped nor received but paid for in full. I asked for my money be returned and they said to have express mailed through FedEx. They are messing with me or are absolutely ignorant, FedEx doesn't deliver to PO boxes. The check should have been sent express through USPS, I offered a replacement address. Since no receipt of any express mail with a check enclosed, they have said three days in a row to wire the funds to my bank and nothing. These guys are crooks. At this point I can only assume they cannot cover the funds.",N/A
Rohan,"Los Angeles, CA","Reviewed Oct. 1, 2016","I was invested in an IRA with Wells Fargo and called my financial advisor to inquire why I hadn't seen any appreciation in the account over the past 6 months. I realized that the banks weren't going to be able to help me preserve and grow my savings. While researching precious metals investments, I stumbled upon Patriot Gold Group. They had a 5 star rating with Consumer Affairs so I decided to give one of their experts a call. Mike **, one of the partners, answered himself and helped me buy $100,000 worth of gold coins at the right price. My IRA is finally protected in tangible gold and silver and I'm hoping to see the returns fall in line with my financial goals. I would recommend Patriot Gold Group without reservation.",5
Soogin,"Chicago, IL","Reviewed Sept. 28, 2016",I'm not an expert by any means of investment and I had in two different accounts of my 401K. I was very nervous about what is happening in our economy and I wanted to find the safest place where I could put precious metal for intended purpose. That's what drove me to call Patriot Gold. I told them I was looking for a place of safety and something that is tangible with more value. They told me to enroll my 408 account over to them. There was no tax implication and it just came into commodity of a precious metal rather than going through all other options. ,5
John,"Irvine, CA","Reviewed Sept. 26, 2016","I purchased silver for home delivery. My transaction went smoothly and Patriot Gold Group shipped my order within five business days as promised. Since my initial purchase, I now receive news and articles by email concerning the markets on a weekly basis. I'm finding the updates to be informative and helpful. I will continue to purchase precious metals through Patriot Gold Group and I would recommend Patriot Gold Group to anyone who is looking to purchase gold or silver.",5
Stephen,"Greensboro, NC","Reviewed Sept. 23, 2016","Patriot Gold's team was friendly, however, I talked to their guy for a while and once he got my account, that was the last that I heard from him. There's no statement. He had overcharged me for the gold I bought compared to what is in the market price. It wasn’t a good experience but I’m okay with it now.",N/A

Vicki,"Madison, WI","Reviewed Sept. 17, 2016","Our experience with Patriot Gold has been excellent. When we made the decision to go with them, we called and talked with Jason. He was very good and informative. We talked about more things than just what I was buying. He sent me a few things about silver and a lot of literature to my e-mail, which I read. It was very nice. In fact, when we wanted to buy some more, we went right back to Jason.",5

Linda,"Tyler, TX","Reviewed Sept. 14, 2016","Someone who used to be with Lear has gone over to Patriot Gold. He told me he was leaving the other outfit and so after he moved, I called Patriot Gold and requested that he continue on with my stuff and so it got moved over there. He helped us in the past and so he’s garnered our trust in him. Based on recommendations he makes, I just want to follow them because they’d paid off in the past. He recently put out some e-mails about things that are going on with Patriot Gold which are informative and I appreciate that. I am highly satisfied with them. I really liked their team a lot. I've talked to someone who sells on the team and he was gracious and so I haven't had a bad time with them at all. It’s more than just business when I talk to him. He takes an interest and knows a little about the family and I really appreciate that.",5
William,"Sarasota, FL","Reviewed Sept. 13, 2016","My experience with Patriot Gold was great. I worked with Charley and he is wonderful. I actually heard about Patriot Gold through him. He was with a different company, but he's been doing the business a long time and now partnered with the group. I've always been loyal to him because he's been fantastic in what he does. So it's not as much Patriot Gold as it is Charley. No expert gold traders and gold. For that matter, Charley is my guy and I've been very impressed with him. Frankly, if he left tomorrow, I'd be where he is. So as far as Patriot Gold is concerned, the best thing they can do for their business is take good care of Charley.",5
Patrick,"Baltimore, MD","Reviewed Sept. 9, 2016","Lear Capital attempted to shaft me nearly three years ago. Within two hours of that very disturbing conversation, their website promise a $500 credit to my size of Precious metal IRA. Then one of their salespeople tried to deny it. I later came to understand that it was not their policy to try to cheat their new customers. It was only that one sales representative. So almost miraculously, this is two years before Patriot Gold went into business. Two of their owners came in, took my IRA and did a very fair exchange on some of the gold coin set that were not very liquid and gave me a very fair compensation that added to some $25,000 for those eight ounces. They saved me from Lear’s clutches. Two hours after that some three years ago, Charlie called me and by what he said convinced me that not every precious metal dealer have their talons out for unwary customers.",5
Bob,"Massapequa Park, NY","Reviewed Aug. 17, 2016","Personally, I have only just recently joined the Patriot family of clients... Having dealt with and trusted Charley ** for years. In my book, market knowledge and customer service are expected as absolute minimums... It is rather the trust that is earned and maintained that actually MEAN something in an admittedly fickle market such as this. It is in this regard that I count Charley as my sole precious metals expert... But also, my friend. I firmly and confidently recommend Patriot to anyone seeking to preserve some wealth, especially through trying times.",5

Patrick,"Baltimore, MB","Reviewed Aug. 12, 2016","I had purchased metals from three previous precious metal dealers in the past and by FAR! my experience with Patriot Gold Group has been the best. One previous dealer went out of business soon after shafting me by marking up a huge box (#500) of private-minted one oz. 2013 Britannia coins by $10 each, after describing them as proof coins. However, I found out that they were not certified after they had been shipped to the Delaware depository and then they went out of business (after some 26 years of business!). They charged some $18,000 against my $61,000 IRA by marking each 1 oz. coin up by $10 premium per coin. I have come to understand that each Britannia silver coin is really worth little more than melt value! They also stuck me with some 8 oz. of proof coins in sets, that are very difficult to liquidate.",5

Jack's candid approach and patience to explain things in a way I can understand is very much appreciated. Any important decision I make is preceded by a discussion with Jack **. He explains pros and cons, short-term expectations and long-term strategy for my precious metals IRA. I trust his recommendations.
